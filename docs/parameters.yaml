name: ConfigBase
description: |+
  The directory containing the Pelican configurations and data when the utility
  is run as non-root.  Automatically configured; cannot be overridden.
default: "~/.config/pelican"
components: ["*"]
type: filename
---
name: ConfigLocations
description: |+
  `ConfigLocations` provides administrators a way to define a list of directories containing Pelican configuration files. Within a given directory,
  files are read in lexicographical order, and any keys that are defined in multiple files will take the value from the last file read. Directories are
  read in the order provided by the list. For example, specifying:

  `ConfigLocations: ["/configs1", "/configs2"]`

  will read files first from `/configs1` and then from `/configs2`. If a key is defined in both `/configs1`
  and `/configs2`, the value from `/configs2` will be used. If `/configs1` contains files `a.yaml` and `b.yaml` where both define the same key, the value
  from `b.yaml` will be used.

  Subdirectories of the provided directories are not read. Only the root config file's `ConfigLocations` key is used, and any redefinitions are ignored.
type: stringSlice
default: []
components: ["*"]
---
name: Debug
description: |+
  A bool indicating whether Pelican should emit debug messages in its log.
  NOTE: this will override whatever is set within your configuration file under Logging.Level!
type: bool
default: false
components: ["*"]

name: TLSSkipVerify
description: |+
  When set to true, Pelican will skip TLS verification. This allows a "man in the middle" attack on the connection but can simplify testing.  Intended for developers.
type: bool
default: false
components: ["cache", "director", "origin", "registry"]
---
name: IssuerKey
description: |+
  [Deprecated] Use IssuerKeysDirectory instead.

  A filepath to the file containing a PEM-encoded ECDSA private key which will be used
  to sign credentials issued by this server.

  A public key will be derived from this private key and used as the key for token verification
  by external services.

  The use of `IssuerKeysDirectory` is preferred as it allows administrators to have more than
  one signing key.

name: IssuerKeysDirectory
description: |+
  A filepath to the directory used for storing one or multiple PEM-encoded ecdsa private keys. The most recent modified
  private key will be parsed into a JWK and serves as the active private key to sign various JWTs issued by this server.

  A public JWK will be derived from this private key and used as the key for token verification.

components: ["client", "registry", "origin"]
---
name: GeoIPOverrides
description: |+
  A list of IP addresses whose GeoIP resolution should be overridden with the supplied Lat/Long coordinates (in decimal form). This affects
  both server ads (for determining the location of origins and caches) and incoming client requests (for determining where a client request is
  coming from).

  Configuration takes an IP address (both regular and CIDR) and a Coordinate made up of a lat/long pair in decimal format. For example:

  ```yaml
  GeoIPOverrides:
    - IP: "123.234.123.234"
      Coordinate:
        Lat: 43.073904
        Long: -89.384859
    - IP: "ABCD::1234/112"
      Coordinate:
        Lat: 39.8281
        Long: -98.5795
  ```

  Will result in the IP address "123.234.123.234" being mapped to Madison, WI, and IP addresses in the range ABCD::0000-FFFF will be mapped
  to a field in Kansas.

name: Origin.Exports
description: |+
  A list describing the origin's exports. Each item in the list describes a single namespace the origin exports:

  - StoragePrefix: The relevant path from the object store, e.g. for posix /my/dir
  - FederationPrefix: The namespace prefix that data from StoragePrefix is made available under within the federation
  - Capabilities: A list of the capabilities the origin is willing to support for the given export. Capabilities include:
      ["Reads", "PublicReads", "Writes", "Listings", "DirectReads"]
      where each of these has the same effect as the corresponding "Origin.Enable*" configuration, except scoped to the
      given export. If "PublicReads" is included, "Reads" is inferred.
  - SentinelLocation: A filename under `StoragePrefix` path for Pelican to check the storage directory exists and is correctly mounted.
      The value must be a file and contain no directory. Leave it empty to skip the check.

      You should always choose a distinct name for `SentinelLocation`. It should not be reused for other servers.
      If running in a containerized environment it should not be the name of the underlying physical host as that may change and lead to confusion.
      You need to manually create a file under path to `StoragePrefix` with the same name as `SentinelLocation`.

      Note that this parameter is only available for the POSIX backend.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    Origin.Exports
      - StoragePrefix: /home/foo/bar
        FederationPrefix: /demo/project
        Capabilities: ["Reads", "PublicReads", "Writes", "Listings", "DirectReads"]

  An absolute path to the directory where xrootd will create its default `namespace`, `meta`, and `data` directories. For example,
  setting `Cache.StorageLocation=/run/pelican/cache` without specifying further `Cache.DataLocations` or `Cache.MetaLocations`
  values will result in the cache creating a directory structure like:
  ```
  .
  └── /run/pelican/cache/
      ├── data/
      │   ├── 00 # hexadecimal name values
      │   ├── 01
      │   ├── ...

          └── namespace2/
              └── bar.txt --> /run/pelican/cache/data/FF
  ```
  In this setup, actual data files live at `/run/pelican/cache/data` and are given hexadecimal names, while
  references (symbolic links) to those files are stored in `/run/pelican/cache/namespace`. The `meta` directory
  is used for object metadata. Object requests to XRootD will be served from the namespace directories, and
  resolve the underlying object through these symbolic links.

  We recommend tying the `Cache.StorageLocation` to a fast storage device, such as an SSD, to ensure optimal cache performance.
  If this directory does not already exist, it will be created by Pelican.

  WARNING: The default value of /var/run/pelican should _never_ be used for production caches, as this directory is typically
  cleared on system restarts, and may interfere with system services if it becomes full. Running a cache with the default value
  set will generate a warning at cache startup.

description: |+
  When the director receives a client request that needs to be redirected to a cache, it will use this method to

  from the client.

  Available methods include:
  - "distance": Sorts caches by their spherical distance from the client.
  - "distanceAndLoad": Sorts caches according to both their distance and a calculated load. This is currently a placeholder,
    and returns the same ordering as "distance".
  - "random": Sorts caches randomly.
  - "adaptive": Sorts caches according to stochastically-generated weights that consider a combination of factors,
      including a cache's distance from the client, its IO load, and whether the cache already has the requested object.
      See details at https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/discussions/1198.  Note that if `Director.CheckCachePresence`

  - `file`: Read groups from an external, JSON-formatted file.  The file should contain a single JSON object
    with keys corresponding to the "user" name and the value a list of strings that are interpreted as the
    user's groups.
  - `oidc`: Take group information from the identity token provided by the OIDC identity provider.  Parses

description: |+
  The authorizations that should be generated for an authenticated request.  Value should be a list of
  authorized actions.

  Each action is a key-value pair with the following keys defined:
  - `actions`: A list of authorized actions.  Valid string values are `read`, `modify`, and `create`.
  - `prefix`: A prefix where the actions are authorized.  If the prefix contains the substring `$USER`, the
    string is replaced with the authenticated username.  If the prefix contains the substring `$GROUP`, then
    an authorization is emitted for _each group_ authenticated.

  For example, if the request is authenticated as user `bbockelm` with groups `dept_a` and `dept_b`, then
  the following configuration:

  ```yaml
  - actions: ["read", "create"]
    prefix: /projects/$GROUP
  - actions: ["read", "modify"]
    prefix: /home/$USER

###################################
name: OIDC.ClientIDFile
description: |+
  A filepath to a file containing an OIDC Client ID.

  This is used by the namespace registry to allow OAuth2/OIDC login and authenticated namespace registration.
  By default, Pelican uses [CILogon](www.cilogon.org) as the authentication provider. You need to first register an OIDC _client_ at CILogon:
  https://cilogon.org/oauth2/register. If you'd like to use other authentication providers, you need to change
  other endpoint parameters under OIDC configuration to the endpoints of your provider,
  such as `OIDC.AuthorizationEndpoint`, `OIDC.UserInfoEndpoint`, etc.

  `OIDC.ClientIDFile` is mutually exclusive with `OIDC.ClientID`. The value of `OIDC.ClientID` will
  override the value of `OIDC.ClientIDFile` if both are set.

  This is a required parameter for the registry server.
  This is a required parameter for the origin/cache/director server if
  `Origin.EnableOIDC`/`Cache.EnableOIDC`/`Director.EnableOIDC` is set to `true`, respectively.

  It is worth noting that the picking sensible values is really important. The Prometheus server will reject any metrics that exceed the limit,
  meaning that the metrics will not be scraped and will not be available for querying. If it is too large we could exceed the memory limits of Prometheus.

name: Lotman.PolicyDefinitions
description: |+
  A list of named Lotman purge policy definitions that may be enabled by the cache administrator through setting the `Lotman.EnabledPolicy`
  configuration. Each policy definition is an object with the following fields:
  - `PolicyName`: The name of the policy. This is used to identify the policy in the `Lotman.EnabledPolicy` configuration.
  - `PurgeOrder`: An ordered list of strings indicating the order in which lots should be purged. The strings should be one of the following:
    - `del`: Purge lots that have passed their deletion time.
    - `exp`: Purge lots that have passed their expiration time.
    - `opp`: Purge lots that have passed their opportunistic storage quota.
    - `ded`: Purge lots that have passed their dedicated storage quota.
  - `DiscoverPrefixes`: A boolean indicating whether Lotman should automatically discover prefixes from the Director. If true, Lotman will
    attempt to create lots for all discovered federation prefixes. Locally-defined lots will take precedence over discovered lots if the two have
    the same name.
  - `MergeLocalWithDiscovered`: A boolean indicating whether Lotman should merge locally-defined lot configurations with discovered namespaces.
    Most Lot configuration fields will take precedence from local configuration, but the `Paths` and `Parents` fields are additive.
  - `DivideUnallocated`: A boolean indicating whether Lotman should attempt to make intelligent decisions regarding management policy attributes
    for lots that have not provided explicit values. These decisions are based on the cache's total storage capacity and the number of lots
    that have been explicitly configured, and are intended to maximize potential cache utilization. This should be set to "true" in most cases.
  - `Lots`: A list of lot objects, each of which describes a "lot". Every lot can be defined with the following:
    - `LotName`: REQUIRED. The name of the lot.  This is used to identify the lot in the LotMan database.
    - `Owner`: REQUIRED. A string identifying the owner of the lot's data (as opposed to someone who can modify the lot itself).
      The Owner field should generally be set to the issue for the lot's namespace path. For example, if the lot
      tracks namespace `/foo/bar`, the owner might be set to `https://registry.com/api/v1.0/registry/foo/bar`.
    - `Paths`: OPTIONAL. A list of path objects, each of which describes a path that should be managed by the lot.
        - `Path`: REQUIRED. The path to be managed by the lot.
        - `Recursive`: REQUIRED. A boolean indicating whether the path should be managed recursively. If true, the lot will
          manage all files and directories under the specified path.
    - `ManagementPolicyAttrs`: REQUIRED. The lot's management policy attributes object. This contains information about resources the lot should
      be allocated, and how it should be managed.
        - `DedicatedGB`: REQUIRED. The amount of storage, in GB, that should be dedicated to the lot. This means the lot can assume it
          always has access to this quantity.
        - `OpportunisticGB`: REQUIRED. The amount of opportunistic storage, in GB, the lot should have access to, when storage is available.
        - `MaxNumObjects`: REQUIRED. The maximum number of objects a lot is allowed to store.
        - `CreationTime`: REQUIRED. A unix timestamp indicating when the lot should begin being considered valid. Times in the future indicate
          the lot should not be considered valid until that time.
        - `ExpirationTime`: REQUIRED. A unix timestamp indicating when the lot expires. Lots may continue to function after expiration, but lot
          data owners should recognize the storage is at-will and may be preempted at any time.
        - `DeletionTime`: REQUIRED. A unix timestamp indicating when the lot and its associated data should be deleted.

  For example, Lotman could be configured with the "my-policy" policy with the following:
  ```yaml
  Lotman:
    EnabledPolicy: "my-policy"
    PolicyDefinitions:
    - PolicyName: "my-policy"
      DivideUnallocated: true
      PurgeOrder: ["del", "exp", "opp", "ded"]
      DiscoverPrefixes: true
      MergeLocalWithDiscovered: true
      Lots:
      - LotName: "/foo/bar"
        Owner: "https://registry.com/api/v1.0/registry/foo/bar"
        Paths:
          Path: "/foo/bar"
          Recursive: true
        ManagementPolicyAttrs:
          DedicatedGB: 100
          OpportunisticGB: 100
          MaxNumObjects: 1000
          CreationTime: 1614556800
          ExpirationTime: 1614556800
          DeletionTime: 1614556800
      - LotName ... <additional lots>
  ```

name: Lotman.EnabledPolicy
description: |+
  The name of the policy to use with Lotman's purge logic. Policy names are defined in the Lotman.PolicyDefinitions list object.
  If unset, the "fairshare" policy is used, which evenly divides the cache's space amongst all top-level namespaces discoverable
  through the Director and purges data according in order of lots past deletion, lots past expiration, lots past opportunistic
  storage, and lots past dedicated storage. The "fairshare" policy is defined as follows:
  ```yaml
  Lotman:
    EnabledPolicy: "fairshare"
    DefaultLotExpirationLifetime: "2016h"
    DefaultLotDeletionLifetime: "4032h"
    PolicyDefinitions:
    - PolicyName: "fairshare"
      DivideUnallocated: true
      PurgeOrder: ["del", "exp", "opp", "ded"]

name: Lotman.DefaultLotExpirationLifetime
description: |+
  The default expiration lifetime for lots that have not provided an explicit expiration time. Valid time units are:
    - ns for nanoseconds
    - us (or µs) for microseconds
    - ms for milliseconds
    - s for seconds
    - m for minutes
    - h for hours

  This value is fed to Lotman as a unix timestamp in microseconds, adjusted from the current time.
