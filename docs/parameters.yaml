  A list of IP addresses whose GeoIP resolution should be overridden with the supplied Lat/Long coordinates (in decimal form). This affects
  both server ads (for determining the location of origins and caches) and incoming client requests (for determing where a client request is
  coming from).

  Configuration takes an IP address (both regular and CIDR) and a Coordinate made up of a lat/long pair in decimal format. For example:
  ```
  GeoIPOverrides:
    - IP: "123.234.123.234"
      Coordinate:
        Lat: 43.073904
        Long: -89.384859
    - IP: "ABCD::1234/112"
      Coordinate:
        Lat: 39.8281
        Long: -98.5795
  ```

  will result in the IP address "123.234.123.234" being mapped to Madison, WI, and IP addresses in the range ABCD::0000-FFFF will be mapped
  to a field in Kansas.
