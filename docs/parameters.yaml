  A list of IP addresses whose GeoIP resolution should be overridden with the supplied Lat/Long coordinates (in decimal form). This affects
  both server ads (for determining the location of origins and caches) and incoming client requests (for determing where a client request is

  Configuration takes an IP address (both regular and CIDR) and a Coordinate made up of a lat/long pair in decimal format. For example:
  ```
  GeoIPOverrides:
    - IP: "123.234.123.234"
      Coordinate:
        Lat: 43.073904
        Long: -89.384859

      Coordinate:
        Lat: 39.8281
        Long: -98.5795
  ```

  will result in the IP address "123.234.123.234" being mapped to Madison, WI, and IP addresses in the range ABCD::0000-FFFF will be mapped
  to a field in Kansas.

name: Shoveler.IPMapping
description: >-
  IP Mapping for remote IP addresses in forwarding to the destinations. You may either
  pass one IP address to map all messages to the configured origin, or a list of key-value pairs for one-to-one mapping.

  One-to-all mapping:

  ```
  IPMapping:
    - All: "172.0.0.4"
  ```

  If a packet comes in with the private ip address of 192.168.0.4, the packet origin will be changed to 172.0.0.4
  The port is always preserved.

  One-to-one mapping:

  ```
  IPMapping:
    - Source: "192.168.0.5"
      Dest: "172.0.0.5"
    - Source: "192.168.0.6"
      Dest: "129.93.10.7"
  ```
