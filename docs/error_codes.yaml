############################
#    Client Error Codes    #
############################

# The below client error codes are 4 digits and each digit has a specific meaning:
# 1st digit: The type of error
# 2nd digit: Nothing yet
# 3rd digit: Represents if the user/submitter can do a modification to fix the error (1 if it is at user's fault, 0 otherwise)
# 4th digit: The sub-type of the error

# The clientExitCode is the code that is used to exit the client process

# Retryable is a boolean value that indicates if the error could be solved with a HTCondor job retry.
# This means that the whole client process will restart with the HTCondor job so the process could succeed
# if it hits a different cache/site or hits the same cache/site when it is in a better state.
