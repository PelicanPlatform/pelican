# Managing Administrator Credentials

Pelican services maintain multiple types of credentials:
- The *admin password* provides access to the server's web interface.
- The *namespace private key* can create arbitrary new credentials (user tokens) for a portion of the federation's namespace.

This page covers various topics in managing these credentials.

## Pre-generate Credentials

### Namespace Private Key

> **Note**: The namespace private key is a **powerful secret** and should never be shared with others.  With the private key, one can create user credentials that can **arbitrarily read or write into your namespace**.

Pelican services rely on a private/public key pair for creating (signing) and verifying the user credentials (tokens) used to read or write objects.  When a new prefix in the data federation is created, an associated public key must be provided; the corresponding private key can generate any arbitrary permissions (including delete!) within the namespace.  For more information about namespace registration, see details [here](../federating-your-data.mdx#obtain-the-public-key-of-the-origin).

When a Pelican origin or other service is started, the server automatically generates a new private key if one is not present.  However, if someone is running the origin on your behalf, you will need to generate the keypair on your own and send the public portion to the origin operator. If you're doing the deployment, it can also be convenient to generate the key-pair in advance and mount the private key file to the Pelican server via configuration variable, especially in a container environment.

The Pelican binary ships with a `pelican generate keygen` for generating a private/public key pairs:

```bash copy
pelican generate keygen
```

Pelican will generate both the private key and the public key under the current working directory:

```console
Successfully generated keys at:
Private key: /path/to/issuer.jwk
Public Key: /path/to/issuer-pub.jwks
```

You can change the location of the generated keys by passing in  arguments `private-key` and/or `public-key`:


```bash copy
pelican generate keygen --private-key /tmp/foo --public-key /tmp/bar
```

For origin operators, the generated *private key* can be specified in the a Pelican server configuration via the `IssuerKey` parameter so that the server will use the newly-generated key:


```yaml filename="pelican.yaml" copy
IssuerKey: /path/to/generated/issuer.jwk
```

If you need to use multiple private keys, place the newly generated private key into the directory specified by `IssuerKeysDirectory`. A token or payload signature will be considered valid if it can be verified by any key found at either `IssuerKey` or within `IssuerKeysDirectory`.

If there is a remote operator for your origin, email them the **public key** portion.  Never send anyone your private key.  A sample public key looks like the following:

```bash
$ cat issuer-pub.jwks
{
	"keys": [
		{
			"alg": "ES256",
			"crv": "P-256",
			"kid": "N3Tks9H791dG7bdzjjlQzV-fwwCrnXd_mcd_2D5ZvYE",
			"kty": "EC",
			"x": "9IIkGEzyWywecBsIisrJsH-_XqMal-U25dthHewUC5w",
			"y": "h_1DUotM2qnLPPRia6hGXNKZdpi92VJ5u_NSrZ-pd0c"
		}
	]
}
```

A sample private key has the following format:
```bash
$ cat issuer.jwk
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
M0G+AgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgzeomq6yJvek0fg2Z
g+NY6qklGz4ZjVlrRgTDT9hk5EShRANCAAT0giQYTPJbLB5wGwiKysmwf79eoxqX
5Tbl22Ed7BQLnIf9Q1KLTNqpyzz0YmuoRlzSmXaYvdlSebvzUq2fqXdH
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### Web Interface Administrator Password

By default, Pelican's administrator web interface requires a username/password to be setup to access.  This password can be enabled by a one-time passcode the server writes into the log file.  However, by pre-generating the credential, Pelican server administrators can skip the initial setup and automate installation.

The `pelican generate` command generates the [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html)-formatted password file for storing the web interface administrator login password. To generate a password file, run:

```bash copy
pelican generate password
```

and Pelican will prompt you to enter and confirm the password:

```console
Enter your password:
Confirm the password:

Successfully generated the admin password file at: /path/to/server-web-passwd
```

You can change the location of the generated htpasswd file by the `-o` or `--output` argument. You can also provide the file that contains your password through the `-p` or `--password` argument.

```bash copy
pelican generate password -o /path/to/generated-htpasswd-file -p /path/to/password
```

The generated htpasswd file can then be passed to the Pelican server via `Server.UIPasswordFile` configuration parameter.

```yaml filename="pelican.yaml" copy
Server:
  UIPasswordFile: /path/to/generated-htpasswd-file
```

## Key Auto-Generation, Multiple Keys and Key Replacement

### Key Auto-Generation

Starting with Pelican v7.13.0, if no pre-generated private key is found at either `IssuerKey` or within `IssuerKeysDirectory`, Pelican server will automatically generated a new private key file in PEM format inside `IssuerKeysDirectory`.

```
IssuerKeysDirectory/
├── pelican_generated_<TIMESTAMP_IN_MILLISECONDS>_<RANDOM_CHARS>.pem
└── ...
```

### Multiple Keys

Pelican supports multiple keys from v7.13.0. Server administrator can place additional `.pem` file into `IssuerKeysDirectory`, and any valid private key in this directory or at `IssuerKey` can be used to verify token or payload signature. 

When selecting a key for signing, Pelican automatically chooses the private key with the lexicographical smallest filename. 

```
ConfigBase
├──IssuerKey
└──IssuerKeysDirectory/
	├── pelican_generated_<TIMESTAMP_IN_MILLISECONDS>_<RANDOM_CHARS>.pem
	├── <ANY_NAME>.pem
	└── ...
```

Pelican scans the above directory every 60 seconds to detect newly added or removed private keys. When [retrieving public keys](/federating-your-data/origin#obtain-the-public-key-of-the-origin), Pelican dynamically generate them from the current set of private keys on-the-fly. If `Server.IssuerJwks` is specified, Pelican also includes public keys from that `.jwks` file.

### Key Replacement

With support for Multiple Keys, Pelican allows administrator to replace private keys anytime. Follow these steps to replace an existing key:

- Add the new private key file to [IssuerKeysDirectory](#multiple-keys).
- (Optional) If you don't have the corresponding public key, [obtain it](/federating-your-data/origin#obtain-the-public-key-of-the-origin) and keep it in mind. If only see the old public key appears, wait for 60 seconds and check again.
- Visit the [Registry](https://osdf-registry.osg-htc.org/view/registry/) and download the latest registered public key set for your server under "Origins" section. Ensure the new public key is included. If it isn't, wait for 60 seconds and retry.
- Remove the old private key from [IssuerKeysDirectory](#multiple-keys)
- Wait for 60s, then go back to the [Registry](https://osdf-registry.osg-htc.org/view/registry/), download the latest registered public key set again. Verify the old public key has been removed.
