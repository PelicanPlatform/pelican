Launch a Pelican Director

### Synopsis

Launch a Pelican Director service:

		The Pelican Director is the primary mechanism by which clients/caches
		can discover the source of a requested resource. It has two endpoints
		at /api/v1.0/director/origin/ and /api/v1.0/director/object/, where the
		former redirects to the closest origin supporting the object and the
		latter redirects to the closest cache. As a shortcut, requests to the
		director at /foo/bar will be treated as a request for the object from
		cache.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for director
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string       config file (default is $HOME/.config/pelican/pelican.yaml)
  -d, --debug               Enable debug logs
  -f, --federation string   Pelican federation to utilize
      --json                output results in JSON format
  -L, --log string          Specified log output file
      --version             Print the version and exit
```
