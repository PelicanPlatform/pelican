# Install Pelican as unprivileged Linux user

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Linux operating system as a standalone binary without any special administrator privileges.

## Quickstart

To download the latest version of Pelican and unpack it into the default location for user binaries on most Linux hosts, copy/paste
the following into a terminal:

```bash
wget -O - "https://dl.pelicanplatform.org/latest/pelican_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz" | tar zx -C ~/.local/bin/ --strip-components=1
```

To test the binary, execute:

```bash
pelican --version
```

If a version number did not print, then you may have a special platform or configuration on your host; follow the subsequent sections.  Otherwise, you're done and may follow the [Next Steps](#next-steps).

## Download Pelican Binary

1. Navigate to the [Pelican download page](../install.mdx#download-pelican-binary) to select the Pelican standalone binary you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architectures** section, select **X86_64** or **ARM64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of candidates, copy the link to `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` or `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`, as appropriate.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    tar -zxvf -C ~/.local/bin/ --strip-components=1 pelican_Linux_$(uname -m).tar.gz
    ```

    > **Note**: The shell should expand `$(uname -m)` with the machine's hardware platform.  If it fails, you may need to replace the filename with `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` with `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz`, as appropriate.

    Example to install Pelican standalone binary on an `X86_64` machine:

    ```bash
    $ wget https://dl.pelicanplatform.org/latest/pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    $ tar -zxvf -C ~/.local/bin/ --strip-components=1 pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    ```

## Make Pelican Binary Available

The above command extracted the binary from the `tar` file and placed it inside `.local/bin/` in your home directory.  On most Linux distributions, this makes the binary automatically available.

You may test this by running:

```bash
command -v pelican
```

If it outputs a path like this example:

```bash
$ command -v pelican
/home/username/.local/bin/pelican
```

then you may skip this section.  If not, you need to alter the `PATH` environment variable that controls which directories are searched for binaries.

### Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` for the current terminal

To change the `PATH` variable for only the currently-running terminal session, execute the following line:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/:$PATH"
```

Example outputs:

```bash
$ export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/:$PATH" # Add ~/.local/bin/ to the PATH
$ pelican --version # Run Pelican binary

### Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` permanently

To add the `~/.local/bin/` directory to your `PATH` variable permanently, execute the following line (assuming you are using the 'bash' shell):

```bash
echo "export PATH="\$HOME/.local/bin/:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Example outputs:

```bash
$ echo "export PATH=\$HOME/.local/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc # Add the .local/bin folder to your .bashrc file
$ source ~/.bashrc # Apply the change
$ pelican --version # Run Pelican binary
