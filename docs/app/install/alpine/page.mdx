# Install Pelican on Alpine

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Alpine Linux operating system.

## Install Pelican APK

You can install Pelican by downloading an `.apk` package or by downloading a binary `.tar.gz` file. You only need to follow one section below to install.

> **Note**: Pelican Alpine Linux package does not contain dependencies such as `XRootD` for Pelican servers. Use [Pelican Docker image](./docker.mdx) instead if you want to serve a Pelican server.

### Install the Pelican using an APK package

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx#download-pelican-binary) and select the Pelican APK you want to install.

2. In the **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architectures** section, select **X86_64** or **ARM64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican_x.x.x_p1_x86_64.apk` if you select **X86_64**, or `pelican_x.x.x_p1_aarch64.apk` if you select **ARM64**, where `x.x.x` is the version number.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    sudo apk add --allow-untrusted pelican_7.5.8_p1_x86_64.apk
    ```

    > **Note**: You need to replace `pelican_7.5.8_p1_x86_64.apk` with `pelican_7.5.8-1_aarch64.apk` if you are running an `ARM64` machine.

    Example to install Pelican `v7.5.8` APK package on an `X86_64` machine:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_7.5.8_p1_x86_64.apk
    sudo apk add --allow-untrusted pelican_7.5.8_p1_x86_64.apk
    ```
