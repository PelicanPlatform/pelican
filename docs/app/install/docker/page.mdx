# Run Pelican Server with Docker Image

This document explains how to run a Pelican server using Pelican docker image. If you want to use Pelican client functionalities, such as to download or upload an object, refer to the [install page](../install.mdx) to download and install a Pelican binary instead.

## Before starting

Pelican builds separate images for each Pelican server components, e.g. origin, cache, director, and registry. Depending on which Pelican server you want to run, you need to select a different Docker image from the list below.

* Pelican origin server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest`
* Pelican cache server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest`
* Pelican director server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest`
* Pelican registry server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest`

<Callout type="info">
The `latest` tag will pull the Pelican server image with the latest released version. You may pull an image with explicit Pelican version by passing the version as the tag (e.g. `v7.6.4`) instead. For a list of available tags, refer to [Pelican Harbor repository](https://hub.opensciencegrid.org/harbor/projects/883/repositories/origin/artifacts-tab?publicAndNotLogged=yes).
</Callout>

## Run Pelican server via Docker CLI

This section describes how to run various Pelican server images using the Docker CLI. If you haven't installed Docker engine, follow the [documentation from Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install and start the Docker engine first.


### Run Pelican origin server

To run the latest pelican origin server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest serve -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar -f <federation>
```

Where:

* `docker run` is a Docker CLI command that runs a new container from an image
* `-it` (`--interactive --tty`) runs the container in interactive mode and uses a tty terminal
* `-p <host-port>:<container-port>` (`--publish`) publishes a container’s port(s) to the host, allowing you to reach the container’s port via a host port. In this case, we can reach the container’s port `8444` via the host’s port `8444`. Note that the admin website of Pelican servers run on port `8444` by default, and the objects transfer endpoint of the Pelican origin server runs on port `8443` by default.
* `-v <host-location>:<container-location>` (`--volume`) binds mount a volume from the host location(s) to the container's location(s). This allow you to share files in your host machine to the container. In this case, we bind `/path/to/your/data/` on your host machine to `/tmp/pelican` in the container. You need to replace `/path/to/your/data/` to the directory where your data to publish is located.
* `--name` assigns a logical name to the container (e.g. pelican-origin). This allows you to refer to the container by name instead of by ID.
* `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest` is the image to run
* `serve` is the command to run the Pelican binary
* `-v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar` is the Pelican argument to bind `/tmp/pelican` directory in the container as namespace `/foo/bar` in Pelican. You need to change `/foo/bar` to a meaningful path that can represent your data, e.g. `/chtc/public-data`. You may pass additional arguments to Pelican server by appending them after this argument.
* `-f <federation>` sets the federation discovery URL, where `<federation>` is the URL to the federation the origin will be joining in. For instructions on how to find a federation to join, refer to [Serve a Pelican Origin](../serving_an_origin.mdx#find-a-federation-to-join)

### Run Pelican cache server

To run the latest pelican cache server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8442:8442 --name=pelican-cache hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest serve -f <federation>
```

Where most of the command overlaps with the one to run the Pelican origin server, with the following differences:
* `-p 8444:8444 -p 8442:8442` publishes port `8444` and `8442` from the container to the same port on the host machine. Note that the admin website of the Pelican server runs on port `8444` by default, and the objects transfer endpoint of the Pelican cache server runs on port `8442` by default.

### Run Pelican director server

<Callout type="warning">
To successfully run a Pelican director server, additional configuration is required. Follow [Serve a Pelican Director](../serving_a_federation.mdx#serve-a-director) for instructions. For how to pass configurations to Docker container, refer to [the next section](#configure-pelican-server-in-a-container).
</Callout>

To run the latest pelican director server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 --name=pelican-director hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest serve -f <federation>
```

### Run Pelican registry server

<Callout type="warning">
To successfully run a Pelican registry server, additional configuration is required. Follow [Serve a Pelican Registry](../serving_a_federation.mdx#serve-a-registry) for instructions. For how to pass configurations to Docker container, refer to [the next section](#configure-pelican-server-in-a-container).
</Callout>

To run the latest pelican registry server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 --name=pelican-registry hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest serve -f <federation>
```

## Stop Pelican container

To stop the Pelican container, run the following command:

```bash
# The `docker ps` command shows the processes running in Docker
docker ps

# This will display a list of containers that looks like the following:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE  COMMAND   CREATED  STATUS   PORTS    NAMES
0be1a304b5d7   hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest   "/bin/sh"   1 hour ago   Up 1 hour   0.0.0.0:8444->8444/tcp   pelican-director

# To stop the pelican container run the command
# docker stop <container-ID> or use
# docker stop <container-name>, which is `pelican-director` as previously defined
docker stop pelican-director
```

## Configure Pelican server in a container

There are two ways to configure a Pelican server running in a container. One is through the environment variables, the other is by passing a `pelican.yaml` configuration file to the container. This section includes instructions for both.

### Configure via environment variables

Most Pelican configuration parameters described in [parameters page](../parameters.mdx) can be passed to a Pelican server as environment variables. For a configuration parameter, the corresponding environment variable is `PELICAN_<PARAMETER_NAME>`, where `PELICAN` is the prefix, and `<PARAMETER_NAME>` is the name of the parameter, with dots `.` replaced by underscores `_`. For example, a Pelican configuration named `Logging.Level` has a corresponding environment variable named `PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL`.

To pass environment variables to the Docker container, append `-e` flag to your `docker run` command. For example, if you want to pass  `PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL` to the container, run:

```bash
docker run -it -e PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest serve -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar -f <federation>
```

There are other ways to pass environment variables to a Docker container, see details in [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#env).

<Callout type="info">
Some of Pelican configuration parameters with the `object` type can not be passed as environment variables, such as [GeoIPOverrides](../parameters.mdx#GeoIPOverrides) and [Origin.Exports](../parameters.mdx##Origin-Exports). For these parameters, use a configuration file instead.
</Callout>

### Configure via the configuration file

Pelican servers can also be configured via a configuration file in `yaml`. The default location that Pelican looks for a configuration file is `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` if Pelican runs as the root user (which is the case when the Pelican server is running in a container). If the Pelican server runs as a non-root user, the default location is `~/.config/pelican/pelican.yaml`.

It is recommended that admins bind a Pelican configuration file on the host machine to the container running the Pelican server. Follow the steps below for instructions.

1. Prepare a `yaml` file on the host machine:

    ```bash
    touch pelican.yaml
    ```

2. Modify and save the `pelican.yaml` file on host machine with the following content:

    ```yaml filename="pelican.yaml"
    Logging:
      Level: debug
    ```

2. Bind the configuration file on the host machine to the container when running the Pelican server image:

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican -v $PWD/pelican.yaml:/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest serve -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar -f <federation>
    ```

    where
    * `-v $PWD/pelican.yaml:/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` is the flag to bind the `pelican.yaml` file under current working directory `$PWD` to `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` directory inside the container


4. You should note that your running Pelican origin server is logging debug level messages.

## Additional Configurations for Running Pelican in a Container

### Server hostname and port

Pelican server has a built-in web server to handle various API requests. By default, it uses server hostname and a port number as the server address (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8444`). In a container environment, the hostname is an alphanumeric value, e.g. `6ee28c5df997`, and the corresponding Pelican server address is `https://6ee28c5df997:8444`. This value is for container internal communications and is not accessible from outside of the container. In local deployment, to access the container ports from the host machine, one can publish a port from inside the container to the host machine.

```bash
docker run -p 8444:8444 origin
```

However, Pelican server still recognize `6ee28c5df997` as its hostname, causing a mismatch.

In practice, there is usually a reverse-proxy service (such as Nginx, Traefik, etc.), to direct traffic from a human-readable domain name (e.g. https://example-origin.org) to your container (e.g. `6ee28c5df997:8444`). If Pelican server doesn't catch this information and uses it as its server address, there will be a mismatch when the server advertises itself to other Pelican services.

Therefore, to keep things consistent, Pelican internally should use the same human-readable domain name as its web server's _external address_. To do so, configure `Server.ExternalWebURL` to the domain name the outside world uses to access the Pelican web service, e.g. https://example-origin.org:8444 for a production service or https://localhost:8444 for a local deployment.

Notice that there is a port number, `8444`, following the hostname in the URLs above. This is the default port for Pelican web server. When publishing ports from the container, you may choose a different port on the host machine to publish to. Two conventional options are `443` or `8080`, which are default ports for a web service. If you publish `8444` port from the container to `443`, or `8080` on the host machine, i.e. `docker run -p 8444:443`, you may remove the port number from `Server.ExternalWebURL`, i.e. `https://example-origin.org`. For other ports, you need to leave the port number in the URL.

## Persisting Data Across Container Restarts

When running Pelican servers in containers, certain files and directories need to persist across container restarts to maintain server identity, configurations, and data.
Without proper volume mounts, restarting a container will cause data loss, including cryptographic keys, databases, and configuration files.

This section describes which data should be persisted for each Pelican server type and how to configure volume mounts appropriately.

### Quick Reference: Essential Volume Mounts

The table below shows the minimum recommended volume mounts for each server type at the directory level.
For additional information about using config params to set the location of specific files in your container, see the section for your service.

| Server Type | Essential Volume Mounts |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **All** | `-v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican` <br/> `-v /host/pelican/lib:/var/lib/pelican` <br/> `-v /host/pelican/certificates:/etc/pelican/certificates` |
| **Origin** | 'All' + <br/> `-v /host/data:/data` (your data directory) |
| **Cache** | 'All' + <br/> `-v /host/cache/storage:/var/cache/pelican` (cache storage) |
| **Director** | 'All' + <br/> `-v /host/pelican/maxmind:/var/cache/pelican/maxmind` (optional, for GeoIP) |
| **Registry** | 'All' (no additional mounts required) |

<Callout type="warning">
The `/etc/pelican` directory contains cryptographic keys that establish your server's identity in the federation.
Loss of these keys will cause the "namespace is registered with a different key" error for Caches/Origins, and loss of the Director's issuer key will cause federation-wide issues with Cache/Origin Director tests.
See ["Issuer Keys Directory"](./docker#issuer-keys-directory) for more information.
</Callout>

### Understanding Default Paths

Pelican uses different default paths depending on whether the server runs as root (which is the case in containers):
- **Root user** (including root-ly containers such as in Docker, and in unprivileged containers where pelican still appears to run as PID 0): Configuration and data are stored in `/etc/pelican` and `/var/lib/pelican`
- **Non-root user**: Configuration and data are stored in `~/.config/pelican`

All examples below assume the server runs as root inside a container.

### Mounting Directories vs Individual Files

The volume mount examples in this document show mounting entire directories (e.g., `-v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican`).
This is the recommended approach for Docker deployments as it's simpler and ensures all related files are persisted together.

However, in some deployment scenarios (such as Kubernetes with sealed secrets), you may need to mount individual files instead of entire directories.
In such cases, consult the configuration parameter documentation linked for each file to determine or customize the file's path.
Each file's default location is also specified in the sections below.

### Data That Should Persist for All Server Types

The following data should be persisted for all Pelican server types (Origin, Cache, Director, Registry):

#### Issuer Keys Directory

**Configuration**: To customize the path, see the [`IssuerKeysDirectory`](../parameters.mdx#IssuerKeysDirectory) parameter.

**Purpose**: Contains PEM-encoded ECDSA private keys used to sign credentials issued by the server.
These keys establish the server's cryptographic identity within the federation.

**Default Path**: `/etc/pelican/issuer-keys`

**Best Practice**: Pre-generate these keys outside the container and mount them into the container's issuer keys directory.
This prevents accidental re-generation of keys in the event of a typo in volume mounts, as the keys remain persisted on the host.

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/issuer-keys:/etc/pelican/issuer-keys
```

For mounting individual key files:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/issuer.pem:/etc/pelican/issuer-keys/issuer.pem
```

**Why it must persist**: If these keys are lost, the server will generate new ones, causing authentication failures with other federation services that trust the old keys.
For Caches/Origins, this is the source of the "namespace/service is registered with a different key" error.
When this error is encountered, you must contact your federation's administrators to have them delete the old registration.
For security, this cannot be fixed without help from the federation administrators.

#### Server Database

**Configuration**: To customize the path, see the [`Server.DbLocation`](../parameters.mdx#Server-DbLocation) parameter.

**Purpose**: Stores server state and operational data.

**Default Path**: `/var/lib/pelican/pelican.sqlite`

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/lib:/var/lib/pelican
```

For mounting individual database files:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/pelican.sqlite:/var/lib/pelican/pelican.sqlite
```

#### Web UI Password File

**Configuration**: To customize the path, see the [`Server.UIPasswordFile`](../parameters.mdx#Server-UIPasswordFile) parameter.

**Purpose**: Stores the hashed+salted password for accessing the server's web UI.

**Default Path**: `/etc/pelican/server-web-passwd`

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican
```

For mounting individual password files:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/server-web-passwd:/etc/pelican/server-web-passwd
```

#### TLS Certificates and Keys

**Configuration**: To customize paths, see [`Server.TLSCertificateChain`](../parameters.mdx#Server-TLSCertificateChain), [`Server.TLSKey`](../parameters.mdx#Server-TLSKey), and [`Server.TLSCACertificateFile`](../parameters.mdx#Server-TLSCACertificateFile) parameters.

**Purpose**: TLS certificate chain and private key for HTTPS communication.
Generally you _must_ mount these into your container because while Pelican will generate them if they're not provided, the Pelican-generated versions are self-signed and will not be trusted by most other web services.

**Default Paths**:
- Certificate chain: `/etc/pelican/certificates/tls.crt`
- Private key: `/etc/pelican/certificates/tls.key`
- CA certificate: `/etc/pelican/certificates/tlsca.pem`

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/certificates:/etc/pelican/certificates
```

For mounting individual certificate files:
```bash
-v /host/tls.crt:/etc/pelican/certificates/tls.crt
-v /host/tls.key:/etc/pelican/certificates/tls.key
-v /host/tlsca.pem:/etc/pelican/certificates/tlsca.pem
```

#### Session Secret File

**Configuration**: To customize the path, see the [`Server.SessionSecretFile`](../parameters.mdx#Server-SessionSecretFile) parameter.

**Purpose**: Secret used for encrypting/decrypting session data for the web UI and CSRF protection.

**Default Path**: `/etc/pelican/session-secret`

**Volume Mount**: Included in the `/etc/pelican` mount above.

#### Log Files (Optional)

**Configuration**: To send service logs to a file rather than stdout/stderr, see the [`Logging.LogLocation`](../parameters.mdx#Logging-LogLocation) parameter.

**Purpose**: Server log files for troubleshooting and monitoring.

**Default Path**: Logs are written to stderr/stdout by default, but can be redirected to a file.

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/logs:/var/log/pelican
```

#### Prometheus Monitoring Data (Optional)

**Configuration**: To customize the path, see the [`Monitoring.DataLocation`](../parameters.mdx#Monitoring-DataLocation) parameter.

**Purpose**: Prometheus monitoring data and metrics.

**Default Path**: `/var/lib/pelican/monitoring/data`

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/monitoring:/var/lib/pelican/monitoring
```

#### OIDC Client Credentials (If Using OIDC)

**Configuration**: To customize paths, see [`OIDC.ClientIDFile`](../parameters.mdx#OIDC-ClientIDFile) and [`OIDC.ClientSecretFile`](../parameters.mdx#OIDC-ClientSecretFile) parameters.

**Purpose**: OIDC client ID and secret for OAuth2/OIDC authentication.

**Default Paths**:
- Client ID: `/etc/pelican/oidc-client-id`
- Client secret: `/etc/pelican/oidc-client-secret`

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican
```

For mounting individual credential files:
```bash
-v /host/oidc-client-id:/etc/pelican/oidc-client-id
-v /host/oidc-client-secret:/etc/pelican/oidc-client-secret
```

### Origin-Specific Persistent Data

In addition to the common data above, Origins need to persist:

#### Origin Database

**Configuration**: To customize the path, see the [`Origin.DbLocation`](../parameters.mdx#Origin-DbLocation) parameter.

**Purpose**: Origin-specific operational data and state.

**Default Path**: `/var/lib/pelican/origin.sqlite`

**Volume Mount**: Included in the `/var/lib/pelican` mount above.

#### Origin Data Directory

**Configuration**: Use the [`Origin.Exports`](../parameters.mdx#Origin-Exports) parameter to define exports.
For example, in `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml`:
```yaml
Origin:
  Exports:
    - StoragePrefix: /data
      FederationPrefix: /my-namespace
```

**Purpose**: The actual data being served by the Origin (if using POSIX storage).

**Default Path**: Configured via the [`Origin.Exports`](../parameters.mdx#Origin-Exports) parameter.

**Volume Mount Example**:
```bash
-v /host/data:/data
```

#### Example: Running an Origin with Persistent Data

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pelican-origin \
  -p 8444:8444 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/lib:/var/lib/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/certificates:/etc/pelican/certificates \
  -v /host/data:/data \
  hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest \
  serve
```

<Callout type="info">
All Origin configuration, including exports and federation URL, should be provided via `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` which is mounted into the container.
</Callout>

### Cache-Specific Persistent Data

In addition to the common data, Caches need to persist:

#### Cache Storage Location

**Configuration**: Set [`Cache.StorageLocation`](../parameters.mdx#Cache-StorageLocation) to point to the mounted cache storage.
In `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml`:
```yaml
Cache:
  StorageLocation: /var/cache/pelican
```

**Purpose**: Directory where cached objects are stored.

**Default Path**: `/run/pelican/xrootd/cache`

**Important**: The default path is in `/run`, which is typically a temporary filesystem.
All Cache administrators should change this value to point at their mounted cache disks to ensure cached data persists across container restarts.
If this configuration is not changed, cached data will fill up `/run`, potentially causing system instability and the Cache will lose all cached objects on restart.

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/cache/storage:/var/cache/pelican
```

**Why it must persist**: Without persistence, the Cache loses all cached objects on restart, increasing load on Origins and slowing down data access due cache misses.

#### Example: Running a Cache with Persistent Data

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pelican-cache \
  -p 8444:8444 \
  -p 8442:8442 \
  -v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/lib:/var/lib/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/certificates:/etc/pelican/certificates \
  -v /host/cache/storage:/var/cache/pelican \
  hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest \
  serve
```

Note: All Cache configuration, including federation URL, should be provided via `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` which is mounted into the container.

### Director-Specific Persistent Data

In addition to the common data, Directors need to persist:

#### GeoIP Database (Optional)

**Configuration**: To customize paths, see [`Director.GeoIPLocation`](../parameters.mdx#Director-GeoIPLocation) and [`Director.MaxMindKeyFile`](../parameters.mdx#Director-MaxMindKeyFile) parameters.

**Purpose**: MaxMind GeoIP database for geographic routing optimization.

**Default Path**: `/var/cache/pelican/maxmind/GeoLite2-City.mmdb`

**Volume Mount**:
```bash
-v /host/pelican/maxmind:/var/cache/pelican/maxmind
```

#### Example: Running a Director with Persistent Data

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pelican-director \
  -p 8444:8444 \
  -v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/lib:/var/lib/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/certificates:/etc/pelican/certificates \
  -v /host/pelican/maxmind:/var/cache/pelican/maxmind \
  hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest \
  serve
```

Note: All Director configuration, including federation URL, should be provided via `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` which is mounted into the container.

### Registry-Specific Persistent Data

Registries only require persisting the directories/files discussed in the ["Data That Should Persist for All Server Types"](./docker#data-that-should-persist-for-all-server-types) section.

#### Example: Running a Registry with Persistent Data

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pelican-registry \
  -p 8444:8444 \
  -v /host/pelican/config:/etc/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/lib:/var/lib/pelican \
  -v /host/pelican/certificates:/etc/pelican/certificates \
  hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest \
  serve
```

<Callout type="info">
All Registry configuration, including federation URL, should be provided via `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` which is mounted into the container.
</Callout>

### Using Docker Compose for Persistent Data

For production deployments, Docker Compose provides a cleaner way to manage volumes.
Here's an example for an Origin:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  pelican-origin:
    image: hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest
    container_name: pelican-origin
    ports:
      - "8444:8444"
      - "8443:8443"
    volumes:
      - pelican-config:/etc/pelican
      - pelican-lib:/var/lib/pelican
      - pelican-certs:/etc/pelican/certificates
      - /path/to/data:/data
    command: serve
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  pelican-config:
  pelican-lib:
  pelican-certs:
```

Note: Configuration including exports and federation URL should be provided in a `pelican.yaml` file placed in the `pelican-config` volume.

### Best Practices

1. **Always persist `/etc/pelican` and `/var/lib/pelican`**: These directories contain most of the critical persistent data.

2. **Use named volumes or bind mounts consistently**: Avoid mixing approaches to prevent confusion.

3. **Back up databases regularly**: The SQLite databases in `/var/lib/pelican` should be backed up regularly.

4. **Protect private keys**: The issuer keys and TLS private keys in `/etc/pelican` are sensitive and should be protected with appropriate file system permissions on the host.

5. **Monitor disk usage**: Cache storage and monitoring data can grow over time. Monitor disk usage and configure appropriate limits.

6. **Test container restarts**: After setting up persistent volumes, test that the container can be stopped and restarted without losing data or generating new keys.

7. **Document your volume mounts**: Keep a record of which host directories are mounted to which container paths for each server.
