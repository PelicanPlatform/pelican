# Install Pelican on MacOS

This document explains how to install Pelican on MacOS.

## Install Pelican as a Standalone Executable

Pelican provides a binary executable file instead of a `DMG` installer for MacOS, so installation must happen through a terminal. This process entails downloading/extracting the executable and adding it to your computer's `PATH` environment variable.

1. If you've not yet determined which executable you need, refer to the [download page](../install.mdx#determine-which-executable-to-download) and copy the relevant link: In the **Operating System** section, select **macOS**. In **Architectures** section, select **X86_64** or **ARM64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

    > **Note:** If you don't know your computer's architecture, click the **Apple menu** ï£¿ in the top-left corner of your screen, then click **About This Mac** and check the **Chip** or **Processor** field. If it mentions **Intel** your computer needs Pelican's **X86_64** executable, and if it mentions Apple M1, M2, or later, you'll need the **ARM64** executable. Intel Macs (x86_64) should see the file `pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` and Apple Silicon Macs (ARM64) should see `pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz`.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to a directory where you can download, extract and store the Pelican executable. Then use your command line tools of choice to download and extract the link you copied in the previous step. The rest of these instructions assume `curl` for downloading and `tar` for extraction:

    ```bash
    curl -LO <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    tar -zxvf <name-of-downloaded-file>
    ```

    Example to install Pelican executable for an Apple Silicon Mac:

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.10.5/pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    ```

1. There should now be another directory called `pelican-<version>` containing a Pelican executable that you can run directly using a relative `./` path. For example:

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican-7.10.5
    $ ./pelican --version # Print the executable version

    Version: 7.10.8
    Build Date: 2024-10-09T14:56:56Z
    Build Commit: 1ef2c25a1585803e0c74a9e41fceb214b80bf3da

    ```

    However, to make the `pelican` command available everywhere on your Mac without needing a relative path, you still need to add it to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

## Add Pelican Executable to Your `PATH`

  * Add the Pelican executable to your `PATH` for the current terminal session (disappears after closing the terminal)

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican-7.10.5 # Go to the executable folder
    $ export PATH=$PWD:$PATH # Add current folder to the PATH
    $ pelican --version # Run Pelican executable

    Version: 7.10.8
    Build Date: 2024-10-09T14:56:56Z
    Build Commit: 1ef2c25a1585803e0c74a9e41fceb214b80bf3da
    Built By: goreleaser
    ```

  * Add the Pelican executable to your `PATH` permanently (persists through terminal restarts)

    ```bash
    $ cd pelican-7.10.5 # Go to the executable folder
    $ echo "export PATH=$PWD:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc # Add the current folder to your .zshrc file
    $ source ~/.zshrc # Apply the change
    $ pelican --version # Run Pelican executable

    Version: 7.10.8
    Build Date: 2024-10-09T14:56:56Z
    Build Commit: 1ef2c25a1585803e0c74a9e41fceb214b80bf3da

    ```
