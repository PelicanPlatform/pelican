# Install Pelican on CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, Alma, or Rocky

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Red Hat-based Linux distribution system such as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE.

## Install Pelican RPM

You can install Pelican from the standalone RPM, or with the binary `.tar.gz` file. You only need to follow one section below to install.

### Install the Pelican RPM package manually

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx#download-pelican-binary) and select the Pelican RPM you want to install.

2. In the **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architectures** section, select **X86_64** or **ARM64** depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican-x.x.x-1.x86_64.rpm` if you select **X86_64**, or `pelican-x.x.x-aarch64.rpm` if you select **ARM64** (ARM), where `x.x.x` is the version number.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    ```

    Example to install Pelican `v7.5.8` RPM package on an `X86_64` machine:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican-7.5.8-1.x86_64.rpm
    ```
