# Install Pelican via Conda-Forge

This document explains how to install Pelican using conda-forge, a community-led conda channel that provides the `pelicanplatform` package.

## Prerequisites

You'll need either [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) installed on your system. These package managers work across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

> **Note**: The package on conda-forge is named `pelicanplatform` (not `pelican`, which is a different package).

## Install Pelican using Conda

1. First, add the `conda-forge` channel and set channel priority:

    ```bash
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    ```

2. Install `pelicanplatform`:

    ```bash
    conda install pelicanplatform
    ```

## Install Pelican using Mamba

[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) is a faster alternative to conda:

1. Add the `conda-forge` channel and set channel priority:

    ```bash
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --set channel_priority strict
    ```

2. Install `pelicanplatform`:

    ```bash
    mamba install pelicanplatform
    ```

## Available Platforms

The `pelicanplatform` package is available on conda-forge for the following platforms:

* Linux (x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le)
* macOS (x86_64, arm64)
* Windows (x86_64)

## Version Management

To search for available versions:

```bash
conda search pelicanplatform --channel conda-forge
```

Or with mamba:

```bash
mamba search pelicanplatform --channel conda-forge
```
