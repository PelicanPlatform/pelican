### Is it "Pelican" or "Pelican Platform"?

"Pelican Platform" is the proper name for the software described in these documents,
as there are other pre-existing tech projects that use the name "Pelican".

That being said, `pelican` is the name of the command for interfacing with components of the Pelican Project,
and we frequently refer to said components as "Pelican _____" in our documentation as a convenient shorthand.

### How is the Pelican Platform related to the HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)?

Both the Pelican Platform and [HTCSS](https://htcondor.org/) are open-source software technologies whose development is led by the [Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
whose mission is "to bring the power of High Throughput Computing to all fields of research, and to allow the future of HTC to be shaped by insight from all fields."
While the funding for developing these technologies comes from different sources, there is a lot of overlap of the staff that are involved in the development of these technologies.

The flagship instance of HTCSS is the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/ospool/), a nation-wide scientific and research computing platform based in the U.S.
The need for managing the efficient movement of large data within the OSPool led to the creation of the [OSDF](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf).
As adoption of the OSDF became more widespread, it became clear that a separate software platform was needed for deploying and managing the OSDF and other data federations like it, and that software is the Pelican Platform.
Now, the Pelican Plugin Client ships with HTCSS, meaning any computational work that is managed by HTCondor can access data via a Pelican Federation.

## Data Access Model

### Can I use Pelican Platform to search for the data I need?

When a namespace is configured to allow listings, Pelican clients let users search for objects by prefix,
similar to the way you might check for files on a computer with the terminal command `ls /foo/bar/`.
However, this kind of searching is limited in that it can only tell you the names of objects under a prefix as defined by the prefix owner –
it does not necessarily tell you anything about the contents of objects, and it does not guarantee the data owner has chosen descriptive, reasonable names.
This is why Pelican encourages leaving breadcrumbs of data provenance in namespace prefixes, because it gives users information about who to contact for more information.
See [Choosing a Namespace Prefix](/federating-your-data/choosing-namespaces) for more information.

### Can Pelican be used to satisfy "FAIR" data requirements?

Supporting [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) – that is, making data "Findable", "Accessible", "Interoperable" and "Reusable" – is one of Pelican's main goals,
because we believe that FAIR data is the bedrock of robust, open science.

However, at this time Pelican's primary targets are data accessibility and interoperability,
which Pelican supports through its federated approach to data management (accessibility) along with its tight integration with HTCSS and caching mechanisms (interoperability).

While Pelican lets users discover object names by prefix/namespace,
Pelican does not meet the full set of requirements for "Findability" because it has no native integration with data cataloging technologies,
and it provides no way for the generic researcher to answer "where can I get data related to ABC that looks like XYZ".
However, Pelican has partnered with the [National Data Platform](https://www.nationaldataplatform.org/) to explore these concepts further.

Finally, Pelican does not address data "Reusability" because it has no archival features,
and its "object immutability" rules are to prevent undefined behavior, not to guarantee that object contents never change.

All this being said, researchers who use Pelican can still help address "Findability" and "Reusability" through practicing good data hygiene,
such as by choosing a good namespace prefix and structuring object/file names according to best practices.
See [Choosing a Namespace Prefix](/federating-your-data/choosing-namespaces) for more information.

## Using Pelican Platform

### I am using _____ computer with _____ operating system - can I still use Pelican to download objects?

Yes!

The Pelican Platform provides several ways of accessing objects via a Pelican Federation using the Pelican Client.
The most commonly used is the Pelican Command-Line Interface (aka Pelican CLI), which is a standalone program that should be compatible with most modern computers, and it does not require admin permissions to install or use.
As long as you have an internet connection and know how to access the object via a Pelican Federation, you just need to download the Pelican CLI!

Visit [Getting Started - Accessing Data](/getting-started/accessing-data) to get started with the Pelican CLI.

### Why do `osdf:///` URLs use 3 slashes instead of two slashes like regular URLs?

>**TL;DR:** `osdf:///` URLs use three slashes because the `osdf` scheme inherently specifies the networked system, making the federation hostname redundant.
This is similar to how `file:///` URLs work, where the triple slash indicates the resource is on the local machine, eliminating the need for a hostname.
Most Pelican clients should detect and handle `osdf://`-schemed URLs if they're missing the third slash, but this is technically an abuse of the well-defined
URL structure.

URLs, or **Uniform Resource Locators**, play a crucial role in the way computers are able to discover, locate and access digital resources. Since
their broad adoption in the mid 1990s, their structure has become a well-defined internet standard<sup>[1](#triple-slash-fn1)</sup>. To quote their
definition:
> "Uniform Resource Locators" (URLs), in addition to identifying
  a resource, provide a means of locating the resource by describing its
  primary access mechanism (e.g., its network "location").<sup>[2](#triple-slash-fn2)</sup>

Whether you're trying to access a remote PDF or watch your favorite playlist of YouTube cats, the URL you give your browser conveys important
information about _what_ it's supposed to find, _where_ it can look, and _how_ it should be accessed.

Understanding a URLs basic components will help answer why `osdf:///` URLs typically require triple slashes.

For our intents and purposes, URLs contain three main parts -- a _scheme_, a _hostname_ and a _path_, where these pieces can be loosely defined as follows
<sup>[3](#triple-slash-fn3)</sup>:
1. **scheme**: A URL's _scheme_ tells the computer _how_ something should be accessed. In most cases, this specifies a protocol like `https`, `ftp`,
or in our case `pelican` and `osdf`. Essentially, this tells your computer what "language" it needs to speak to interact with the resource.
2. **hostname**: The URL's _hostname_ gives the computer information about who/what remote resource might be able to fulfill your request.
3. **path**: The _path_ component of a URL specifies the name of a requested resource from the requested hostname. Typically this is something like
a specific web page or file.

These components are stitched together in a predictable fashion:
```
<scheme>://<hostname>/<path>
```

For example, when you visit `https://docs.pelicanplatform.org/parameters`, you've defined the URL scheme as `https`, the hostname as
`docs.pelicanplatform.org` and the path as `parameters`. Together, these pieces tell your computer to use HTTPS to access the `parameters` page from
Pelican's `docs.pelicanplatform.org` documentation website.

The `pelican`-schemed URLs you use to access objects from Pelican federations follow the same setup, leading to URLs like:
```
pelican://osg-htc.org/some/object
```
Here, you've indicated you want to use the `pelican` protocol to interact with `some/object` from the `osg-htc.org` federation.

However, some URL schemes are inherent to a specific location and don't need a hostname. If you've ever used a browser to open a PDF on your personal
computer, you've likely seen a URL like `file:///some/path/to/file.pdf`. The triple slash after the `file` scheme happens because `file` already pre-supposes
that the browser needs to get a file from the local machine, so the hostname information isn't needed. It is equally valid to use the URL
`file://localhost/some/path/to/file.pdf`, but that's more to type! Instead, we wind up cutting out the redundant information to yield
> file://~~localhost~~/some/path/to/file.pdf --> file:///some/path/to/file.pdf

Similarly, the `osdf` URL scheme already encodes two pieces of information -- that you're speaking Pelican _and_ you're talking to the OSDF, whose
hostname is `osg-htc.org`. By using `osdf` URLs, you've indicated the object you're interacting with is part of a specific networked system that should
already be understood.

The hostname in the previous `pelican`-schemed URL matches the OSDF's hostname, so it can be rewritten using an `osdf` url:
> pelican://osg-htc.org/some/object --> osdf://~~osg-htc.org~~/some/object = osdf:///some/object

On the other hand, construction of a URL like `osdf://some/object` has the potential to confuse many clients that aren't aware of the `osdf://` protocol.
That is because now there is part of the object's name ("`some`") where such clients might be expecting the federation's hostname.

More information about `pelican` and `osdf` URLs can be found in our [client usage docs](./getting-data-with-pelican/client#the-different-pelican-url-schemes).

> <a id="triple-slash-fn1">**1**</a>: For more information about the structure of URLs, see [RFC 1738](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738).<br />
  <a id="triple-slash-fn2">**2**</a>: For more information on the difference between URIs, URLs and URNs, see [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-1.1.3).<br />
  <a id="triple-slash-fn3">**3**</a>: URLs can also contain things like ports, query parameters and "fragments," and while Pelican makes use of these, they aren't as crucial to understanding
  the question at hand.

### Why isn't Pelican using the closest cache(s) when I download objects?
Whenever a Pelican client tries to download an object, one of its first steps is to talk to the appropriate federation's Director, where the Directors job is to
match the client's request to some service(s) that can best fulfill the request. This usually means giving the client an ordered list of caches that the Director
thinks either have the object or that are capable of delivering the object quickly.

By default, Directors order this list by trying to determine the physical distance between the client and any caches in the federation with closer caches
being assigned higher priority<sup>[1](#geoloc-fn1)</sup>. This troubleshooting guide assumes the Director is configured for distance-based sorting.
There are several ways this process can break.

#### Client Resolution

First, the Director uses the IP address of the incoming client request to generate a lat/long pair and confidence range for the client. It does this by running
the client's IP address through a local database<sup>[2](#geoloc-fn2)</sup>. Issues that can occur at this stage include:
- The IP address reported by the client is invalid, or in a private range (e.g. 192.168.0.12 for IPv4)
- The IP address is valid, but the database doesn't have an entry for it
- The IP address is valid and has an entry, but the database reports a confidence range greater than 900km.
In any of these cases, the Director will decide it can't reasonably determine where the client is, and it will assign a temporary lat/long pair by picking
a coordinate somewhere in the continental US. This coordinate is cached for a short time (~20 minutes), so subsequent requests from the same client will resolve to the
same spot.

If the list of caches you see being tried look like they have a geographic center, but not the _correct_ geographic center, you might try determining the IP
address the Director sees when the client contacts it. This can be done by running:
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```
and running the resulting IP address through [MaxMind's GeoLite City demo](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo). If the location it determines is incorrect,
has a large accuracy radius, or appears to be otherwise invalid, that's likely causing a problem.
> **NOTE**: The database used by this demo is not exactly the same database used by the Director. If you see a problem here, there's definitely an issue, but if
this step yields the expected results, there may still be issues with the Director's database. If the list of caches tried by your client(s) appear to have a
geographic center that's incorrect, contact your federation administrators to ask if they can create a manual override for your IP range.

#### Cache/Origin Resolution
Alternatively, the client's location may be known by the Director, but locations for some caches (or even origins) in the list can't be determined. While the
Director can use a client's IP address directly for geo-location, it uses a DNS lookup against cache/origin hostnames to determine IP addresses. Failure to produce
an IP address in this step means something more fundamental is wrong with the cache/origin, and that it should be fixed before receiving any requests. However,
it's still possible that the resolved IP address is incorrect, or has the same types of issues client IPs might have with the MaxMind database. When this happens,
the server should be sorted to the end of the potential list of servers.

Errors can compound if both of these issues (client _and_ cache/origin geo-location failures) occur. If the cache list you see from the Director has no discernible
geographic center, you should contact your federation administrators for help debugging.

Finally, some Pelican clients may allow you to select a cache manually if you have a strong preference for which cache to use.
For example, the Pelican CLI lets you do this by specifying the cache's hostname/port with the `-c` flag:
```bash
pelican object get -c https://my-chosen-cache:8443 pelican://osg-htc.org/some/object
```
> **NOTE**: Specifying caches in this manner should only be done if you're positive the Director is having sorting troubles -- the Director's sorting algorithms
are no longer tied explicitly to geo-location, and it may be trying to make better decisions based on object availability and the detected load of various caches.

> <a id="geoloc-fn1">**1**</a>: Directors may implement more intelligent cache selection schemes. For a full list of options, see the documentation for the
  Director's [`Director.CacheSortMethod`](./parameters.mdx#Director-CacheSortMethod) config parameter.<br />
  <a id="geoloc-fn2">**2**</a>: In particular, the Director uses the [MaxMind GeoLite City database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite-free-ip-geolocation-data), which it
  updates twice weekly on Wednesdays and Fridays (shortly after the databases are updated upstream by MaxMind).<br />

### How can I tell what services my Pelican client will talk to _before_ I try to get/put objects?
Pelican is built on HTTP, so any client that speaks HTTP can determine this. For more information about Pelican's use of HTTP verbs, see
[Getting Data With Pelican](./getting-data-with-pelican.mdx#getting-data-with-pelican)
These instructions are for using `curl` on the command line. Broadly speaking, they require:
1. Finding the hostname of your federation's Director
2. Determining whether you want the Director to provide a list of caches or origins
3. Creating the correct curl command
4. Interpreting the Director's response headers

If you don't have a working understanding of how Pelican finds and uses Directors in a federation, see
[About Pelican/A First Look Under The Hood ](./about-pelican.mdx#making-bytes-accessible-and-moving-them----a-first-look-under-the-hood) for a quick recap.

#### Discovering your Director
If you have a `pelican`-schemed URL and a terminal with `curl`, you have everything you need to get started.
First, get the federation discovery URL from your `pelican` url, e.g. `pelican://osg-htc.org/some/object` results in the discovery URL of `osg-htc.org`

Next, curl the discovery URL at the `/.well-known/pelican-configuration` path:
```bash
$ curl https://osg-htc.org/.well-known/pelican-configuration
{
  "director_endpoint": "https://osdf-director.osg-htc.org",
  "namespace_registration_endpoint": "https://osdf-registry.osg-htc.org",
  "jwks_uri": "https://osg-htc.org/osdf/public_signing_key.jwks"
}
```
If successful, this should return a JSON. Your federation's Director is the URL provided by the `director_endpoint` key, e.g. `https://osdf-director.osg-htc.org`

#### Deciding Whether to Ask About Caches or Origins
Next, you should determine whether you expect your client to talk to a cache or an origin.
The answer is usually a cache unless you are trying to run<br />
a) GET operation using the "direct read" flags/URL query parameters, or<br />
b) PUT operation to write an object via the origin.

The following steps are very similar in both cases, but require minor adjustments in the way you interact with the Director.

##### Discovering Caches
If you're expecting your client to manipulate objects through a cache, you'll point `curl` at the Director's "object" discovery API, which uses the path
`/api/v1.0/director/object/<your namespace & object>` path prefix.

For the previous `pelican` URL of `pelican://osg-htc.org/some/object`, you'd then construct the following curl command pointed at the Director with the correct path:
```bash
$ curl -v https://osdf-director.osg-htc.org/api/v1.0/director/object/some/object
```

If successful, the Director's response will be a series of HTTP headers with information you can use to answer a variety of questions. In particular, the list of caches
you can expect your client to try are included in the `link` header, which will look something like:
```
link:
<https://osdf-uw-cache.svc.osg-htc.org:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=1; depth=2,
<https://sc-cache.chtc.wisc.edu:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=2; depth=2,
<https://dtn-pas.cinc.nrp.internet2.edu:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=3; depth=2,
<https://osg-kansas-city-stashcache.nrp.internet2.edu:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=4; depth=2,
<https://its-condor-xrootd1.syr.edu:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=5; depth=2,
<https://osg-gftp2.pace.gatech.edu:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=6; depth=2
```

##### Discovering Origins
If you're expecting your client to manipulate objects through an origin, you'll point `curl` at the Director's "origin" discovery API, which uses the path
`/api/v1.0/director/origin/<your namespace & object>` path prefix.

Using the previous `pelican`-schemed URL, you'd then construct the following `curl` command:
```bash
$ curl -v https://osdf-director.osg-htc.org/api/v1.0/director/origin/some/object
```

Once again, the `link` header will include an ordered list of Origins that your client expects to try when looking for `/some/object`:
```
< link: <https://chtc-osdf-origin.chtc.wisc.edu:8443/some/object>; rel="duplicate"; pri=1; depth=1
```
This list is usually much shorter and likely contains a single Origin.

## Federating Data

### Can I run a Pelican Origin from my laptop?

You can, but it is not recommended.

While it is technically possible to run a Pelican Origin for data on your laptop, there are several reasons why you should not.

* Whenever your laptop is closed, runs out of battery, or simply isn’t connected to the internet, the Origin would no longer be available to any researcher who wishes to access that data.
* You would need to restart the Origin each time your laptop shut down.
* There is the potential for high network usage on your laptop if a large amount of the data is requested at once.

### How do I get the public JWKS key from the private key that I have?

Pelican uses cryptographic key pairs for creating and verifying user credentials (tokens). Private keys are stored in PEM format (`.pem` files), while public keys are stored in [JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) format (`.jwks` files). If you have a Pelican-formatted private key and need to derive its corresponding public key, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Locate your private key file

Pelican private keys are stored in PEM format. A typical private key file looks like:
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
M0G+AgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgzeomq6yJvek0fg2Z
g+NY6qklGz4ZjVlrRgTDT9hk5EShRANCAAT0giQYTPJbLB5wGwiKysmwf79eoxqX
5Tbl22Ed7BQLnIf9Q1KLTNqpyzz0YmuoRlzSmXaYvdlSebvzUq2fqXdH
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Private keys are located in the directory specified by the `IssuerKeysDirectory` configuration parameter.

#### Step 2: Use the Pelican CLI to derive the public key

Run the following command to generate the public key from your existing private key:

```bash
pelican key create --private-key /path/to/your/private-key.pem
```

Replace `/path/to/your/private-key.pem` with the actual path to your private key file.

#### Step 3: Retrieve the generated public key

By default, the public key will be generated in the same directory as the private key with the filename `issuer-pub.jwks`. To specify a custom output location, use the `--public-key` flag:

```bash
pelican key create --private-key /path/to/your/private-key.pem --public-key /path/to/output/public-key.jwks
```

#### Step 4: Verify the public key format

The generated public key file should be in JWKS format:
```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "alg": "ES256",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "kid": "N3Tks9H791dG7bdzjjlQzV-fwwCrnXd_mcd_2D5ZvYE",
      "kty": "EC",
      "x": "9IIkGEzyWywecBsIisrJsH-_XqMal-U25dthHewUC5w",
      "y": "h_1DUotM2qnLPPRia6hGXNKZdpi92VJ5u_NSrZ-pd0c"
    }
  ]
}
```
