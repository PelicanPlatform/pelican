# Troubleshooting

This guide details the common errors that occur when working with Pelican, and how to troubleshoot them.

These sections are intended for **end users** who are using Pelican to transfer data:

* [General client issues](#general-client-issues): problems that apply to any implementation of a Pelican client.
* [Pelican CLI](#pelican-cli): problems using the [Pelican CLI](/getting-data-with-pelican/client) client, specifically.
* [Pelican HTCondor Plugin](#pelican-htcondor-plugin): problems using [Pelican's HTCondor file transfer plugin](/getting-data-with-pelican#pelicans-htcondor-plugin), specifically.

These sections are intended for **system administrators** deploying Pelican services:

* [Federating data](#federating-data): problems integrating a data store with an existing Pelican Federation
* [Operating a Federation](#operating-a-federation): problems operating Pelican services used to run a Pelican Federation

## General client issues

Regardless of how a Pelican client is implemented, it will be interacting with the Pelican Federation using a common set of operations, including:

* Connecting to Federation services
* Getting information about a namespace
* Transferring data 

among other things. (For more information, see [About Pelican](/about-pelican) and [Getting Data with Pelican](/getting-data-with-pelican).)
Furthermore, these operations are conducted over the internet and so common networking problems can impact these operations.

### Understanding Pelican client error messages

The Pelican client you are using will return an error if something goes wrong. 
Ideally, you can use this error to understand the problem and what needs to be done.

### Authentication issues

For protected reads and rights, Pelican can integrate with authentication services such as CILogon. 
When you try to run a protected operation, you'll be prompted by Pelican to authenticate, usually by going to a web address in your browser and signing in with the necessary identity.

Often times, the browser will store a cookie regarding your login to remember you next time. 
In some cases, this cookie may become invalid and cause issues with the authentication flow for using Pelican.

We recommend that you clear the cookies in your browser when troubleshooting issues with authenticated actions. 
To do so, follow these instructions:

## Pelican CLI

This section discusses common errors when working with the [Pelican CLI](/getting-data-with-pelican/client) client. 

### Reset local client

If the you've followed the other troubleshooting instructions but you continue to experience the issue,
or if you are experiencing an issue not listed here,
there may be a problem with the local configuration for your client.
You can reset the local configuration as described below.

<Callout type="error">
Resetting your local configuration will remove any stored credentials or custom configuration.
</Callout>

To reset your local configuration on **Linux**/**MacOS**:

1. Move to the containing directory.

    ```bash copy
    cd ~/.config
    ```

    You should see a `pelican` directory when you run `ls`.

2. Remove the `pelican` directory.

    ```bash copy
    rm -r ./pelican
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
    Make sure you avoid any typos! This command will **recursively delete** whatever you provide to it. 
    </Callout>

To reset your local configuration on **Windows**:

1. Move to the containing directory.

    ```powershell copy
    cd ~\.config
    ```

    You should see a `pelican` directory when you run `dir`.

2. Remove the `pelican` directory.

    ```powershell copy
    rm .\pelican
    ```

    If prompted to remove a file, double-check the path before confirming with `Y`.

## Federating data

When setting up an Origin to make your data available via a Pelican Federation, it's good practice to test access using the same mechanism that your target audience will use.
To make it easier to identify failure points, we recommend this ordering:

1. Test that `pelican object ls` works
2. Test that `pelican object get --direct` works
3. Test that `pelican object get` works

In principle, once you've successfully completed a transfer this way, everything should be good to go.

Keep in mind that general networking issues can complicate the testing process, so it's also a good idea to test the transfer multiple times before jumping into troubleshooting your configuration.

### Unable to transfer data via a cache

A common issue is that you **are** able to download an object **directly** from the origin (using the `pelican object get --direct` command) but **are not** able to download the object **via a cache** (using the `pelican object get` command).
