# Troubleshooting

This guide details the common errors that occur when working with Pelican, and how to troubleshoot them.

These sections are intended for **end users** who are using Pelican to transfer data:

* [General client issues](#general-client-issues): problems that apply to any implementation of a Pelican client.
* [Pelican CLI](#pelican-cli): problems using the [Pelican CLI](/getting-data-with-pelican/client) client, specifically.
* [Pelican HTCondor Plugin](#pelican-htcondor-plugin): problems using [Pelican's HTCondor file transfer plugin](/getting-data-with-pelican#pelicans-htcondor-plugin), specifically.

These sections are intended for **system administrators** deploying Pelican services:

* [Federating data](#federating-data): problems integrating a data store with an existing Pelican Federation
* [Operating a Federation](#operating-a-federation): problems operating Pelican services used to run a Pelican Federation

## General client issues

Regardless of how a Pelican client is implemented, it will be interacting with the Pelican Federation using a common set of operations, including:

* Connecting to Federation services
* Getting information about a namespace
* Transferring data 

among other things. (For more information, see [About Pelican](/about-pelican) and [Getting Data with Pelican](/getting-data-with-pelican).)
Furthermore, these operations are conducted over the internet and so common networking problems can impact these operations.

### Reset local client

If the you've followed the other troubleshooting instructions but you continue to experience the issue,
