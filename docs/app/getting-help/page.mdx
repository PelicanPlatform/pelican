## GitHub

Pelican Platform software is published on GitHub under the [PelicanPlatform organization](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform).
The majority of the functionality is published in the [PelicanPlatform/pelican repository](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican).
The software is open source under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file).

### Bug reports

You can report bugs that you encounter via GitHub.

* For a **specific** bug, create a new bug report in the corresponding repository.
  In most cases, that will typically be the `PelicanPlatform/pelican` repository: [Open Bug Report](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

* For **general** issues, or if you're not sure where to file your bug report, you can start a [new discussion in the PelicanPlatform organization](https://github.com/orgs/PelicanPlatform/discussions/new/choose).
  Existing discussions can be found at [github.com/orgs/PelicanPlatform/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/PelicanPlatform/discussions).

Before reporting a bug, we recommend that you

1. Check the [FAQs](/getting-help/faqs) and [Troubleshooting](/getting-help/troubleshooting) pages to see if the behavior is expected.
2. Search the existing issues (typically in [PelicanPlatform/pelican](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/issues)) to see if we are already aware of the problem.

### Feature requests

Features can be requested in a similar manner to reporting bugs.

* To request a **specific feature**, open a new issue in the corresponding repository.

* To request a **general** feature or functionality, or if you aren't sure where to request one, you can open a [new discussion in the PelicanPlatform organization](https://github.com/orgs/PelicanPlatform/discussions/new/choose).
