# Advanced Usage: Plugin

## Passing Configuration for the Pelican Plugin via HTCondor Job Submission

[HTCondor](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
has tight integration with Pelican for managing data transfers 
as part of running jobs on a High Throughput Computing (HTC) system.
The user simply lists the Pelican address for the object(s) they want transferred as part of the HTCondor job,
and HTCondor is responsible for transferring the object(s) at the appropriate points in the job lifecycle.

For example, including the following line within the HTCondor job submit file will cause HTCondor to transfer
the corresponding object to the job's scratch directory before execution:

```
transfer_input_files = pelican://osg-htc.org/pelicanplatform/test/hello-world.txt
```

For more information about data transfers in HTCondor, 
see the HTCondor manual page about its [File Transfer Mechanism](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/file-transfer.html),
especially the section on [File Transfer Using a URL](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/file-transfer.html#file-transfer-using-a-url).

Pelican object transfers as part of an HTCondor job occur at the Execution Point (EP) -
the machine where the job is executing.
The transfers use the Pelican Plugin at the EP
as configured by the EP owner.
Currently, there is no way to pass additional arguments to the `pelican object` command-equivalent used at the EP.

There is, however, a way to modify the environment variables that are set prior to the object transfer command.
That means as long as the `pelican object` command respects the specific environment variable(s), 
the user submitting the HTCondor job can modify the Plugin's transfers as desired.

### Pelican environment variables

Configuration options listed in the [configuration parameters table](/parameters) are typically set via the `pelican.yaml` file.
If, however, there is a corresponding environment variable set in the shell where the command is executed,
that will override the configuration provided in the `pelican.yaml` file.
To demonstrate the syntax for setting the environment variable, 
consider the following example.

To set the logging level for a Pelican component to "Debug" in the `pelican.yaml` file, 
you would use the following:

```yaml
# /etc/pelican/pelican.yaml
Logging:
  Level: Debug
```

To set the logging level for a Pelican component to "Debug" via an environment variable, 
you would use

```bash
export PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL=Debug
```

Note that the environment variable is prefixed by `PELICAN_` and
that the nested keys are capitalized and separated by underscores (`_`).

### Setting environment variables for the Plugin as part of HTCondor job

To set a Pelican environment variable to affect the Plugin transfers in an HTCondor job,
declare the environment variables using the `environment` option in the submit file.

```
environment = "PELICAN_OPTION1=value1 PELICAN_OPTION2=value2"
```

> Note that there are a variety of subtleties in how the `environment` value is interpreted;
> it is recommended that you read the corresponding section in the 
> [HTCondor manual](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man-pages/condor_submit.html#environment)
> for all but the simplest definitions.

For example, to configure the Plugin to transfer objects only via a specific cache, 
you would use the following line:

```
environment = "PELICAN_NEAREST_CACHE=https://address.to.desired.cache:port"
```

> This particular example would be useful for testing that a specific cache is operational
> and accessible from the EP the job is running at.
> Use of `PELICAN_NEAREST_CACHE`,  though, bypasses the Director 
> and its logic that helps prevent any one Pelican component in the Federation from being overwhelmed.
>
> For production, it would be better to use the `PELICAN_PREFERRED_CACHE` configuration.
> The cache specified using this option is always tried first, 
> but if there is an issue the Plugin will fall back to the Director for a list of other caches to try.

A couple of things to note about this methodology for configuring the Plugin:

* The configuration is overridden for *all* transfers involving the Plugin within the job.
  This could be especially problematic if transferring objects via different federations within the same job.

* The configuration for the Plugin set by the EP owner is likely optimized for that EP.
  Overriding that configuration could result in performance or network issues.

* Environment variables set using the `environment` option will persist into the job execution environment.
  If additional Pelican transfers are run within the job's executable script, 
  the environment variables will affect those transfers unless unset by the executable script.
