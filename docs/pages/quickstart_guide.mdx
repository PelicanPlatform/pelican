# Quick Start Guide
The Pelican platform provides a platform that makes deploying data and accessing data easy. It provides an open-source software for federating dataset repositories together and delivering objects to computing capacity. For more information on Pelican, visit the [About Pelican](./index.mdx) page.

### Assumptions

Before using the Pelican client to interact with objects, this guide makes several assumptions:

- You are on a computer where you have access to a terminal. The Pelican client is a command line tool.
- You've already installed the version of Pelican appropriate for your system, and Pelican is accessible via your path. To test this on Linux, you can run
```console
which pelican
```
which should output a path to the executable. If there is no output to this command, refer to the [Pelican installation docs](./install.mdx) to acquire a working installation.

### Useful Terminology
**Objects:**
Pelican should be thought of as a tool that works with federated *objects* as opposed to *files*. The reason for this is that calling something a file carries with it the connotation that the file is mutable, i.e. its contents can change without requiring a new name. Objects in a Pelican federation, however, should be treated as **immutable**, especially in any case where objects are pulled through a cache (which will be the case for almost all files in the [Open Science Data Federation](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf), or OSDF). This is because the underlying cache mechanism, powered by [XRootD](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/), will deliver whatever object it already has access to; if an object name changes at the origin, the cache will remain unaware and continue to deliver the old object. In the worst case, when the cache only has a partial object, it may attempt to combine its stale version with whatever exists at the origin. Use object names wisely!


**Federations:**
Objects in Pelican belong to *federations*, which are aggregations of data that are exposed to other individuals in the federation. Each Pelican federation constitutes its own global namespace of objects and each object within a federation has its own path, much like files on a computer. Fetching any object from a federation requires at minimum two pieces of information: a URL indicating the object's federation and the path to the object within that federation (there is the potential that some objects require access tokens as well, but more on that later). For example, the OSDFâ€™s federation URL is https://osg-htc.org and an example object from the federation can be found at the following path:
```console
/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt
```
**Namespace Prefixes:**
Each origin supports one or more *namespace prefixes*, which are analogous to the folders or directories from your computer that you use to organize files. Below is an example object:
```bash
/demo/testfile.txt
```
This is a simple example where the namespace prefix would be `/demo` and the object is named `/testfile.txt`.

However, things can get a little tricky when you add a longer namespace prefix and/or a longer filepath within that namespace where the object lives. For example:
```bash
/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt
```
In this example, the namespace prefix is `/ospool/uc-shared/public/`, and the actual object is named `/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt`. While the namespace prefix always comes before the object name, it can get a little confusing once paths and names get longer.


## Your First Pelican Client Command
Accessing objects from a Pelican federation requires the use of the Pelican client commands. Here we will be using the `pelican object get` command to get an object from a federation. This command is formatted like so:
```console
pelican object get pelican://<federation-url>/<namespace-prefix>/<path/to/federation/object> </local/path/to/destination>
```
We can break down the components of this command before you try it yourself:
- `pelican object get`: This is the client command we are utilizing. `object` because we want to interact with Pelican objects and `get` because we want to GET the file from our federation.
- `pelican://`: This is the URL scheme for accessing this object. Pelican accepts different URL schemes which are detailed in the [client usage](./client_usage.mdx#the-different-pelican-url-schemes) page.
- `<federation-url>`: The URL indicating the object's location.
- `<namespace-prefix>`: The namespace at which this object is located.
- `<path/to/federation/object>`: The file path to the object we would like to get.
- `</local/path/to/destination>`: The local destination where we want the file to download to (can be a local or absolute path)

**Try The Command Yourself**
Now it is time for you to get your first object from a federation. Before getting your first object, be sure you are in a directory/location where you want to download this test file. To get the object, run the command below:
```console
pelican object get pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt downloaded-test.txt
```
>**Note:** with pelican:// URLs like the one above, it is important to include the correct amount of slashes (`/`). This is because pelican URLs rely on the hostname being the federation URL therefore, they must only contain two slashes after `pelican`. For more information, visit the [Client-Usage](./client_usage.mdx#the-different-pelican-url-schemes) page

You should see a progress bar output and eventually a file named `downloaded-test.txt` within your local directory:
```bash
$ pelican object get pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt downloaded-test.txt
downloaded-test.txt 14.00 b / 14.00 b [==============================================================================] Done!
$ ls
downloaded-test.txt
$ cat downloaded-test.txt
Hello, World!
```
