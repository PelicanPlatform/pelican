# Users' Quick Start Guide

Pelican in its heart is a way to transfer data. As a user, you will be interacting mostly with the Pelican Client which has many useful commands at your disposal.

## Before Starting

### Assumptions

Before using the Pelican client to interact with objects from your federation, this guide makes several assumptions:

- You are on a computer where you have access to a terminal. The Pelican client is a command line tool.
- You've already installed the version of Pelican appropriate for your system, and Pelican is accessible via your path. To test this on Linux, you can run
```console
which pelican
```
which should output a path to the executable. If there is no output to this command, refer to the Pelican installation docs to acquire a working installation.

## Downloading your first file from a federation

To download a file from a federation we will be using the `pelican object get` command. This is how we will run the command:

```console
pelican object get pelican://osg-htc.org/osgconnect/public/osg/testfile.txt .
```

Go ahead and give that command a run. If all goes well, you should see a progress bar pop up, complete, and a file named `testfile.txt` within your current directory. Congradulations on downloading your first object using the Pelican Client!

Let's break down that url that we used to download the file, as it contains some important pieces used for accessing data within a Pelican federation.

### pelican://

This piece is the `scheme` for which we want to download the file. Other supported schemes from pelican include `osdf://`, `stash://`, and `http://`. More information can be found here.

### osg-htc.org

This is the federation-url for where we are getting our data. When using a pelican:// scheme, this is necessary. In any other scheme, we do not specify this url.

### osgconnect/public

This is called the namespace-prefix which acts sort of like a directory path but within the federation, it is key for finding where your data lives.

### osg/testfile.txt

This is the name of the object (or file in this case) that we want to download with its location.

## A More In-Depth example

This example will show you more client commands and a more in-depth example of how we can move data around.

Say that I belong to a federation called science-world. This federation is made up of an origin, a cache, a director, and a registry (see docs for more details on these pieces). As a user, I am most interested in the origin and cache pieces because that is where my data might live. Let's say my federation has a url of `science-world.org`. The namespace prefix is `/sw/PROTECTED` and my objects are located at `/JSmith/important_research/`. Also, since my data is `PROTECTED`, I was issued a token that I used to access my data which is in a file called `token.txt`

Now, say I did some important research and would like to add this data to the federation. My data file is called `data.csv` and I can upload using my token like so:

```console
pelican object put data.csv pelican://science-world.org/sw/PROTECTED/JSmith/important_research/data.csv -t token.txt
```

However, say I have a lot more data than one `.csv` file, say I need to upload a whole directory full of `data.csv` files. Say that directory is named `data_dir` and I can upload the whole directory like so:

```console
pelican object put data_dir pelican://science-world.org/sw/PROTECTED/JSmith/important_research/data_dir -t token.txt -r
```

The `-r` flag here is used to specify that we are uploading a directory.
