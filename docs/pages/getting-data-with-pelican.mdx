# Getting Data With Pelican

Pelican is built on top of HTTP and uses the most common [HTTP verbs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) to interact with data:
downloading objects happen with an HTTP "GET", uploading an object is an HTTP "PUT", and discovering data uses a combination of HTTP's "HEAD" and WebDav's "PROPFIND".
This architecture means any tool that already speaks HTTP _can_ integrate with Pelican. However, Pelican's official clients -- any of our tools
designed for interacting with remote objects -- make intelligent use of special information provided by federation services like the Director to
deliver the best experience. They also have built-in optimizations that help interact with data more efficiently, like multi-worker object streaming,
automatic retry policies, and tools for packing/unpacking objects while they're in flight.

One of the Pelican Platform's core goals is enabling data access wherever it needs to happen -- whether that's from the the command line, from a browser,
in an HTC workflow, a PyTorch training loop, or a Jupyter Notebook. To that end, we've been working hard to develop and maintain a wide range of clients
that meet our users' diverse needs. Information about each of our clients can be found in this section and are laid out by client type.

## Which Client Is Right For You

Picking a client starts with understanding what you want to accomplish and where you want to accomplish it.

### Pelican's Command Line Client
Pelican's command line client (also referred to as the Pelican CLI) excels at broad object manipulation and management tasks, including writing/reading large
collections of objects, syncing data between local and remote resources, and discovering data that's accessible through a given namespace/federation prefix.
For details about Pelican's CLI, see [Getting Data With Pelican/Command Line Client](./getting-data-with-pelican/client.mdx).

### Pelican's Python Filesystem Specification
If your goal is to integrate Pelican with Python, you're looking for our [Pelican Filesystem Specification](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs), or "FSSpec" for short.
This client lets you interact with Pelican objects at any level of your code, including by plugging Pelican directly into popular Python libraries like [xarray](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs/tree/main/examples/xarray)
and [PyTorch data loaders](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs/tree/main/examples/pytorch).


### Pelican's HTCondor Plugin
Pelican maintains a plugin that acts as the preferred transfer tool for [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org/), a software suite used in many distributed/clustered
compute federations, such as the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html).

This plugin leverages HTCondor's existing plugin architecture, enabling HTCondor to manage all `pelican://` and `osdf://` file transfers as part of
distributed, high-throughput computing workflows.

For more information on how file transfer plugins work in HTCondor, see
[HTCondor's documentation](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/file-transfer.html#file-transfer-using-a-url).
