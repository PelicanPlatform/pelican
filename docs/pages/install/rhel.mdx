# Install Pelican on CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Red Hat-based Linux distribution system such as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE.

## Install Pelican RPM

You can install Pelican from the standalone RPM, or with the binary `.tar.gz` file. You only need to follow one section below to install.

### Install the Pelican RPM package manually

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican RPM you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architechtures** section, select **X84_64** (Intel/AMD) or **AARCH64** (ARM) depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican-x.x.x-aarch64.rpm` if you select **AARCH64** (ARM), or `pelican-x.x.x-1.x86_64.rpm` if you select **X84_64** (Intel/AMD). Where `x.x.x` is the version number.

> Note that there are other candidates with `.rpm` extension in the list. If you are downloading a Pelican RPM to run a **Pelican server**, copy the link to `pelican-server-x.x.-aarch64.rpm` or `pelican-server-x.x.x-1.x86_64.rpm` instead. The `pelican-server` RPMs contains config files and systemd service files for pelican servers to help you get started.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    ```

    Example to install Pelican `v7.5.8` RPM for Intel/AMD machine:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican-7.5.8-1.x86_64.rpm
    ```

### Install Pelican as a standalone binary

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican RPM you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architechtures** section, select **X84_64** (Intel/AMD) or **AARCH64** (ARM) depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of candidates, copy the link to `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` if you select **AARCH64** (ARM), or `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` if you select **X84_64** (Intel/AMD).

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    tar -zxvf pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz // ARM user
    ```

    Note that you need to replace `pelican_Linux_arm64.tar.gz` with `pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` if you are running an Intel/AMD machine.

    Example to install Pelican binary for an Intel/AMD machine:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pelican_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    ```

5. At this step, you don't actually install Pelican, you just extract the binary. It is recommended that you add Pelican binary to your `PATH` environment variable to allow Pelican to be called from your command line.

## Uninstall on CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE

1. If you configured Pelican server to run with systemd, stop the systemd service for Pelican server:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop grafana
  ```

2. To uninstall Pelican

  ```bash
  sudo dnf remove replican
  ```

## Verify Pelican is installed

If you installed Pelican as a standalone binary, you need to add Pelican to your `PATH` environment variable before proceeding.

1. Run the following command after you installed Pelican RPM

    ```bash
    which pelican
    ```

    It should output

    ```console
    /bin/pelican
    ```

2. Test Pelican client function by running an **object copy** command that download a test file from Pelican OSG federation to your current directory

    ```bash
    $ pelican -f osg-htc.org object copy /ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt .
    test.txt 14.00b / 14.00b [=============================================================================================] Done!
    ```

## Next steps

If you want to use Pelican client to download or upload files, refer to [Client Usage](../client-usage.mdx) to get started. If you want to serve a Pelican server, refer to [Serve a Pelican Origin](../serving_an_origin.mdx) and [Serve a Pelican Federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx).
