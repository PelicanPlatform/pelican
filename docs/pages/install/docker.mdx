# Run Pelican Server with Docker Image

This document explains how to run a Pelican server using Pelican docker image. If you are installing Pelican to use its client functionalities (download or upload an object), refer to [previous sections](../install.mdx) to download and install a Pelican binary instead.

## Before starting

Pelican builds separate images for each Pelican server components, e.g. origin, cache, director, and registry. Depending on which Pelican server you want to run, you need to select a different Docker image from the list below.

* Pelican origin server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest`
* Pelican cache server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest`
* Pelican director server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest`
* Pelican registry server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest`

> Note: the `latest` tag will pull the Pelican server image with the latest released version. You may pull an image with explicit Pelican version by passing the version as the tag (e.g. `v7.6.4`) instead. For a list of available tags, refer to [Pelican Harbor repository](https://hub.opensciencegrid.org/harbor/projects/883/repositories/origin/artifacts-tab?publicAndNotLogged=yes).

## Run Pelican server via Docker CLI

This section describes how to run various Pelican server images using the Docker CLI. If you haven't installed Docker engine, follow the [documentation from Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install and start the Docker engine first.


### Run Pelican origin server

To run the latest pelican origin server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest serve -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar -f <federation>
```

Where:

* `docker run` is a Docker CLI command that runs a new container from an image
* `-it` (`--interactive --tty`) runs the container in interactive mode and uses a tty terminal
* `-p <host-port>:<container-port>` (`--publish`) publishes a container’s port(s) to the host, allowing you to reach the container’s port via a host port. In this case, we can reach the container’s port `8444` via the host’s port `8444`. Note that the admin website of Pelican servers run on port `8444` by default, and the objects transfer endpoint of the Pelican origin server runs on port `8443` by default.
* `-v <host-location>:<container-location>` (`--volume`) binds mount a volume from the host location(s) to the containter's location(s). This allow you to share files in your host machine to the container. In this case, we bind `/path/to/your/data/` on your host machine to `/tmp/pelican` in the container. You need to replace `/path/to/your/data/` to the directory where your data to publish is located.
* `--name` assigns a logical name to the container (e.g. pelican-origin). This allows you to refer to the container by name instead of by ID.
* `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest` is the image to run
* `serve` is the command to run the Pelican binary
* `-v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar` is the Pelican argument to bind `/tmp/pelican` directory in the container as namespace `/foo/bar` in Pelican. You need to change `/foo/bar` to a meaningful path that can represent your data, e.g. `/chtc/public-data`. You may pass additional arguments to Pelican server by appending them after this argument.
* `-f <federation>` sets the federation discovery URL, where `<federation>` is the URL to the federation the origin will be joining in. For instructions on how to find a federation to join, refer to [Serve a Pelican Origin](../serving_an_origin.mdx#find-a-federation-to-join)

### Run Pelican cache server

To run the latest pelican cache server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8442:8442 --name=pelican-cache hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest serve -f <federation>
```

Where most of the command overlaps with the one to run the Pelican origin server, with the following differences:
* `-p 8444:8444 -p 8442:8442` publishes port `8444` and `8442` from the container to the same port on the host machine. Note that the admin website of the Pelican server runs on port `8444` by default, and the objects transfer endpoint of the Pelican cache server runs on port `8442` by default.

> Note that Pelican docker image currently does not support binding a directory on your host machine as the directory for Pelican cache to store cache files, i.e. using `-v /host/machine:/run/pelican/cache/location`. We will have an update once we officialy support this flow.

### Run Pelican director server

To run the latest pelican director server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 --name=pelican-director hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest serve -f <federation>
```

> Note that to successfully run a Pelican director server, additional configuration is required. Follow [Serve a Pelican Federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx) for instructions.

### Run Pelican registry server

To run the latest pelican registry server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 --name=pelican-registry hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest serve -f <federation>
```

> Note that to successfully run a Pelican registry server, additional configuration is required. Follow [Serve a Pelican Federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx) for instructions.


## Stop Pelican container

To stop the Pelican container, run the following command:

```bash
# The `docker ps` command shows the processes running in Docker
docker ps

# This will display a list of containers that looks like the following:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE  COMMAND   CREATED  STATUS   PORTS    NAMES
0be1a304b5d7   hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest   "/bin/sh"   1 hour ago   Up 1 hour   0.0.0.0:8444->8444/tcp   pelican-director

# To stop the pelican container run the command
# docker stop <container-ID> or use
# docker stop <container-name>, which is `pelican-director` as previously defined
docker stop pelican-director
```

## Configure Pelican server in a container

There are two ways to configure a Pelican server running in a container. One is through the environment variables, the other is by passing a `pelican.yaml` configuration file to the container. This section includes instructions for both.

### Configure via environment variables

Most Pelican configuration parameters described in [parameters page](../parameters.mdx) can be passed to a Pelican server as environment variables. For a configuration parameter, the corresponding environment variable is `PELICAN_<PARAMETER_NAME>`, where `PELICAN` is the prefix, and `<PARAMETER_NAME>` is the name of the parameter, with dots `.` replaced by underscores `_`. For example, a Pelican configuration named `Logging.Level` has a corresponding environment variable named `PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL`.

> For admins that use Pelican images built for OSDF (with `osdf` prefix to the image tag, such as `osdf-origin`). The environment variables are prefixed by `OSDF` instead of `PELICAN`. The example above should then be `OSDF_LOGGING_LEVEL`.

To pass environment variables to the Docker container, append `-e` flag to your `docker run` command. For example, if you want to pass  `PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL` to the container, run:

```bash
docker run -it -e PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL=debug -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest serve -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar -f <federation>
```

There are other ways to pass environment variables to a Docker container, see details in [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#env).

> Some of Pelican configuration parameters with the `object` type can not be passed as environment variables, such as [GeoIPOverrides](../parameters.mdx#GeoIPOverrides) and [Origin.Exports](../parameters.mdx##Origin-Exports). For these parameters, use a configuration file instead.

### Configure via the configuration file

Pelican servers can also be configured via a configuration file in `yaml`. The default location that Pelican looks for a configuration file is `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` if Pelican runs as the root user (which is the case when the Pelican server is running in a container). If the Pelican server runs as a non-root user, the default location is `~/.config/pelican/pelican.yaml`.

It is recommended that admins bind a Pelican configuration file on the host machine to the container running the Pelican server. Follow the steps below for instructions.

1. Prepare a `yaml` file on the host machine:

    ```bash
    touch pelican.yaml
    ```

2. Modify and save the `pelican.yaml` file on host machine with the following content:

    ```yaml filename="pelican.yaml"
    Logging:
      Level: debug
    ```

2. Bind the configuration file on the host machine to the container when running the Pelican server image:

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican -v $PWD/pelican.yaml:/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest serve -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar -f <federation>
    ```

    where
    * `-v $PWD/pelican.yaml:/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` is the flag to bind the `pelican.yaml` file under current working directory `$PWD` to `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml` directory inside the container


4. You should note that your running Pelican origin server is logging debug level messages.
