# Run Pelican Server using Docker image

This document explains how to run a Pelican server using Pelican docker image. If you are installing Pelican to use its client functionalities (download or upload an object), refer to previous sections to download and install a Pelican binary instead.

## Before starting

Pelican builds separate images for each Pelican server components, e.g. origin, cache, director, and registry. Depending on which Pelican server you want to run, you need to select a different Docker image from the list below.

* Pelican origin server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest`
* Pelican cache server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest`
* Pelican director server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest`
* Pelican registry server: `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest`

> Note: the `latest` tag will pull the Pelican server image with the latest released version. You may pull an image with explicit Pelican version by passing the version as the tag (e.g. `v7.6.4`) instead. For a list of available tags, refer to [Pelican Harbor repository](https://hub.opensciencegrid.org/harbor/projects/883/repositories/origin/artifacts-tab?publicAndNotLogged=yes).

## Run Pelican server via Docker CLI

This section shows you how to run various Pelican server images using the Docker CLI. If you haven't installed Docker engine, follow the [documentation from Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install the Docker engine.


### Run Pelican origin server

To run the latest pelican origin server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8443:8443 -v /path/to/your/data/:/tmp/pelican --name=pelican-origin hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest -v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar
```

Where:

* `docker run` is a Docker CLI command that runs a new container from an image
* `-it` (`--interactive --tty`) runs the container in interactive mode and uses a tty terminal
* `-p <host-port>:<container-port>` (`--publish`) publishes a container’s port(s) to the host, allowing you to reach the container’s port via a host port. In this case, we can reach the container’s port `8444` via the host’s port `8444`. Note that the web engine of the Pelican server runs on port `8444` by default, and the file transfer endpoint of the Pelican server runs on port `8443` by default.
* `-v <host-location>:<container-location>` (`--volume`) binds mount a volume from the host location(s) to the containter's location(s). This allow you to share files in your host machine to the container. In this case, we bind `/path/to/your/data/` on your host machine to `/tmp/pelican` in the container. You need to replace `/path/to/your/data/` to the directory where your data to publish is located.
* `--name` assigns a logical name to the container (e.g. pelican-origin). This allows you to refer to the container by name instead of by ID.
* `hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/origin:latest` is the image to run
* `-v /tmp/pelican:/foo/bar` is the Pelican argument to bind `/tmp/pelican` directory in the container as namespace `/foo/bar` in Pelican. You need to change `/foo/bar` to a meaningful path that can represent your data, e.g. `/chtc/public-data`. You may pass additional arguments to Pelican server by appending them after this argument.

### Run Pelican cache server

To run the latest pelican cache server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 -p 8442:8442 --name=pelican-cache hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/cache:latest
```

> Note that Pelican docker image currently does not support binding a directory on your host machine as the directory for Pelican cache to store cache files, i.e. using `-v /host/machine:/run/pelican/cache/location`. We will have an update once we officialy support this flow.

### Run Pelican director server

To run the latest pelican director server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 --name=pelican-director hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest
```

> Note that to successfully run a Pelican director server, additional configuration is required. Follow [Serve a Pelican Federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx) for instructions.

### Run Pelican registry server

To run the latest pelican registry server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8444:8444 --name=pelican-registry hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/registry:latest
```

> Note that to successfully run a Pelican registry server, additional configuration is required. Follow [Serve a Pelican Federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx) for instructions.


## Stop Pelican container

To stop the Pelican container, run the following command:

```bash
# The `docker ps` command shows the processes running in Docker
docker ps

# This will display a list of containers that looks like the following:
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE  COMMAND   CREATED  STATUS   PORTS    NAMES
0be1a304b5d7   hub.opensciencegrid.org/pelican_platform/director:latest   "/bin/sh"   1 hour ago   Up 1 hour   0.0.0.0:8444->8444/tcp   pelican-director

# To stop the pelican container run the command
# docker stop <container-ID> or use
# docker stop <container-name>, which is `pelican-director` as previously defined
docker stop pelican-director
```
