# Install Pelican on macOS

This document explains how to install Pelican on macOS.

### Install Pelican as a standalone binary

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican macOS binary you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **macOS**. In **Architectures** section, select **X84_64** (Intel) or **ARM64** (ARM) depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of candidates, copy the link to `pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` if you select **ARM64** (ARM), or `pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` if you select **X84_64** (Intel).

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    tar -zxvf pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz // ARM user
    ```

    Note that you need to replace `pelican_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz` with `pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz` if you are running an Intel machine.

    Example to install Pelican binary for an Intel machine:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf pelican_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz
    ```

5. At this step, you don't actually install Pelican, you just extract the binary. It is recommended that you add Pelican binary to your `PATH` environment variable to allow Pelican to be called from your command line.
