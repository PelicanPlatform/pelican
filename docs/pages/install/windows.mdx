# Install Pelican on Windows

This document explains how to install Pelican on Windows.

## Install Pelican as a standalone binary

Pelican provides a binary file instead of a `MSI` installer for Windows. You need to download and extract the binary and add the binary to your `PATH` environment variable.

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx#download-pelican-binary) and select the Pelican Windows binary.

2. In the **Operating System** section, select **Windows**. Download the file `pelican_Windows_x86_64.zip` to your computer.

3. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to folder containing the downloaded `.zip` file and extract it.

4. You may run the binary in the extracted folder, but it is recommended that you add Pelican binary to your `PATH` environment variable to allow `pelican` to be called directly from your PowerShell. To run Pelican binary from the extracted folder, do the following in [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/01-getting-started?view=powershell-7.4):

    ```bat
    rem Go to the downloaded Pelican folder
    $ cd D:\Downloads\pelican_Windows_x86_64

    rem Run Pelican binary
    $ pelican.exe --version

## Add Pelican binary to your `PATH`

* Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` for the current [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/01-getting-started?view=powershell-7.4)

  ```bat
  rem Go to the binary folder
  $ cd pelican_Linux_arm64

  rem Add current folder to the PATH environment variable
  $ $env:PATH += ";$(Get-Location)"

  rem Run Pelican binary
  $ pelican --version

  ```

* Add Pelican binary to your `PATH` permanently

   1. **Open System Properties**:
      * Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press `Enter`.

   2. **Access Environment Variables**:
      * In the System Properties window, go to the `Advanced` tab.
      * Click on the `Environment Variables` button.

   3. **Edit the PATH Variable**:
      * In the Environment Variables window, under the `System variables` section, scroll down and find the `Path` variable, then select it and click `Edit`.
      * In the Edit Environment Variable window, click `New` and add the path to the directory containing `pelican.exe` (e.g., `C:\path\to\directory`).
      * Click `OK` to close all windows.

   4. Verify Pelican is added to `PATH`
      * In a **new** PowerShell window, run the following command:

        ```bat
        rem Run Pelican binary
        $ pelican --version
