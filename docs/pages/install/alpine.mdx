1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican APK you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architechtures** section, select **AMD64** (Intel/AMD) or **ARM64** (ARM) depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican_x.x.x_p1_aarch64.apk` if you select **AARCH64** (ARM), or `pelican_x.x.x_p1_x86_64.apk` if you select **X84_64** (Intel/AMD). Where `x.x.x` is the version number.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command
