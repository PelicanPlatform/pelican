## Install Pelican APK

You can install Pelican by downloading an `.apk` package or by downloading a binary `.tar.gz` file. You only need to follow one section below to install.

### Install the Pelican using an APK pacakge

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](https://docs.pelicanplatform.org/install) and select the Pelican RPM you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architechtures** section, select **AMD64** (Intel/AMD) or **ARM64** (ARM) depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican_x.x.x_p1_aarch64.apk` if you select **AARCH64** (ARM), or `pelican_x.x.x_p1_x86_64.apk` if you select **X84_64** (Intel/AMD). Where `x.x.x` is the version number.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    sudo apk add --allow-untrusted pelican_7.5.8_p1_aarch64.apk
    ```

    Note that you need to replace `pelican_7.5.8_p1_aarch64.apk` with the file name you downloaded to your current directory.
