# Install Pelican on Debian or Ubuntu

This document explains how to install Pelican on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux operating system.

## Install Pelican DEB

You can install Pelican by downloading a `.deb` package or by downloading a binary `.tar.gz` file. You only need to follow one section below to install.

### Install the Pelican using a DEB pacakge

1. Navigate to [Pelican download page](../install.mdx) and select the Pelican DEB you want to install.

2. In **Operating System** section, select **Linux**. In **Architectures** section, select **AMD64** (Intel/AMD) or **ARM64** (ARM) depending on the architecture of your machine.

3. In the list of download candidates, copy the link to `pelican-x.x.x-1_arm64.deb` if you select **ARM64** (ARM), or `pelican-x.x.x-1.amd64.deb` if you select **AMD64** (Intel/AMD). Where `x.x.x` is the version number.

4. Change the following command with the link to the binary you copied in the previous step and run the command

    ```bash
    wget <replace-with-the-link-you-copied>
    sudo dpkg -i pelican_7.5.8-1_arm64.deb
    ```

    Note that you need to replace `pelican_7.5.8-1_arm64.deb` with `pelican_7.5.8-1_amd64.deb` if you are running an Intel/AMD machine.

    Example to install Pelican `v7.5.8` DEB package for an Intel/AMD machine:

    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases/download/v7.5.8/pelican_7.5.8-1_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i pelican_7.5.8-1_amd64.deb
