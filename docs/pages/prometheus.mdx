# Prometheus

> For Pelican `>= 7.4.2`. Older version of Pelican may not include all of the metrics listed.

Pelican servers have [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) embedded by default and provide a handful of Prometheus metrics to monitor server status. You can access the metrics endpoint at `https://<pelican-server-host>:<server-web-port>/metrics` to see all the available metrics and their current values. By default, `/metrics` is a protected endpoint and you are required to login and get authenticated to view the page. You can change `Monitoring.MetricAuthorization` to `false` in config to turn off the authentication.

Pelican also exposes Prometheus [PromQL query engine](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) at `https://<pelican-server-host>:<server-web-port>/api/v1.0/prometheus` where you can query the metrics agianst Prometheus powerful query langauge.

Example: `https://<pelican-server-host>:<server-web-port>/api/v1.0/prometheus/query?query=pelican_component_health_status[10m]` queries the `pelican_component_health_status` metric and shows data collected in past 10 min.

However, Pelican does not support Prometheus native `/graph` endpoint nor other Prometheus native web services other than the two above. For custom data visualizations, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is one of the popular software to use.

# Metrics

Pelican included metrics from built-in [gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) web server, as well as Go runtime. For all metrics available, visit `https://<pelican-server-host>:<server-web-port>/api/v1.0/prometheus/label/__name__/values`.

Pelican also has a set of built-in metrics to monitor Pelican server's status, listed below.

## All Servers

All of the Pelican servers have the following metrics:

### `pelican_component_health_status`

  The health status of Pelican server components. The value can be converted into following status:

  ```
  1: Critical
  2: Warning
  3: OK
  4: Unknown
  ```

  #### Label: `component`

  Label values:
  ```
  "web-ui":       Web interface
  "xrootd"*:      XRootD process
  "cmsd"*:        CMSD process
  "federation"*:  Advertisement to central service
  "director"*:    File transfer test (health test) with the director
  "topology":     Data fetch from Topology server

  *: only available at origin and cache servers
  ```

### `pelican_component_health_status_last_update`

  The timestamp of last update of health status of Pelican server components. The value is UNIX time in seconds. It shares the same label as `pelican_component_health_status`


## Storage Servers (Origin and Cache)

### `xrootd_monitoring_packets_received`

  The total number of [XRootD monitoring](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev56/xrd_monitoring.htm) UDP pacakets received.

  #### Label: `status`

  Label values:
  ```
  "idle": Scheduler threads waiting for work
  "running": Scheduler threads running
  ```

### `xrootd_server_bytes`

  The total number of bytes XRootD sent/received. Ref: https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev56/xrd_monitoring.htm#_Toc138968503 (See `link.in` and `link.out`)

  #### Label: `direction`

  Label values:
  ```
  "tx": Bytes sent
  "rx": Bytes received
  ```

### `xrootd_server_connection_count`

  The total number of server connections to XRootD.

### `xrootd_storage_volume_bytes`

  The storage volume usage on the storage server.

  #### Label: `type`

  Label values:
  ```
  "total":  Total bytes visible on the storage server
  "free":   Available bytes to use
  ```

  #### Label: `server_type`

  Label values:
  ```
  "origin":  Origin server
  "cache":   Cache server
  ```

  #### Label: `ns`

  The top-level namespace the XRootD is serving for. Example: `/foo`

### `xrootd_transfer_bytes`

  The bytes of transfers for individual object. Ref: https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev56/xrd_monitoring.htm#_Toc138968522 (See XrdXrootdMonStatXFR)

  #### Label: `path`

  The path to the object (filename).

  #### Label: `ap`

  Authentication protocol name used to authenticate the client. Default is `https`

  #### Label: `dn`

  Client’s distinguished name as reported by ap. If no name is present, the variable data is null.

  #### Label: `role`

  Client’s role name as reported by prot. If no role name is present, the variable data is null.

  #### Label: `org`

  Client’s group names in a space-separated list. If no groups are present, the tag variable data is null.

  #### Label: `proj`

  Client’s `User-Agent` header when requesting the file. This is used to label the project name that accesses the file.

  #### Label: `type`

  Label values:
  ```
  "read":   Bytes read from file using read()
  "readv":  Bytes read from file using readv()
  "write":  Bytes written to file
  ```

### `xrootd_transfer_operations_count`

  The number of transfer operations performed for individual object. The labels for this metric is the same as the ones in `xrootd_transfer_bytes`

### `xrootd_transfer_readv_segments_count`

  The number of segments in readv operations for individual object. The labels for this metric is the same as the ones in `xrootd_transfer_bytes` except that `type` label isn't available in this metric.


## Director

### `up`

  The Pelican director scrapes Prometheus metrics from all origins and cache servers that successfully advertise to the director. This metric reflects the Pelican origin or cache servers that are scraped by the director.

  #### Label: `server_name`

  The name of the storage server. By default it's the hostname.

  #### Label: `server_type`

  Label values:
  ```
  "Origin": Origin server
  "Cache":  Cache server
  ```

  #### Label: `server_url`

  The storage server XRootD url.

  #### Label: `server_web_url`

  The storage server web url.

  #### Label: `server_auth_url`

  The storage server authentication url.

  #### Label: `server_lat`

  The storage server latitute.

  #### Label: `server_long`

  The storage server longitute.


### `# of Active Origins and Caches`

With the `up` metric, it is possible to count number of active origin and cache servers in the federation by a simple Promtheus query: `count(up{server_type=<"Origin">})` for counting origin servers, or `count(up{server_type=<"Cache">})` for counting cache servers.

### `pelican_director_total_ftx_test_suite`

  The number of file transfer test suite the director issued. In Pelican, director creates a test file and sent to origin servers to as a health test. It issues such test suite when it receives the registration from the origin server. In a test suite, a timer was set to run a cylce of uploading, getting, and deleting the test file every 15 seconds. Such cycle is called a "test run". In theory, director should issue only one test for each origin servers; however, since the registration information was stored in a TTL cache in director, and it expires after certain period of time, and the test suite issued will be cancelled. A new test suite is issued with the new registration. Thus, director _can_ issue multiple test suites to an origin server.

  #### Label: `server_name`

  The name of the storage server. By default it's the hostname.

  #### Label: `server_type`

  Label values:
  ```
  "Origin": Origin server
  "Cache":  Cache server
  ```

  #### Label: `server_web_url`

  The storage server web url.

### `pelican_director_active_ftx_test_suite`

  The number of _active_ director file transfer test suite. As mentioned in previous metric, the test suites are individual tasks running independently from the main program logic. This can cause race condition in some condition where an expired test suite was not cleared but a new test suite is issued for the same origin. This metric records such condition for debugging and monitoring. The value of the metric _should_ be 1 for all the time.

  This metric shares the same label as `pelican_director_total_ftx_test_suite`

### `pelican_director_total_ftx_test_runs`

  The number of file transfer test runs the director issued. A "test run" is a set of upload/get/delete of test files to a origin. It executes in a cycle of 15s (by default).

  This metric shares the same label as `pelican_director_total_ftx_test_suite`, with two additions:

  #### Label: `status`

  Label values:
  ```
  "Success":  The test run succeeded
  "Failed":   The test run failed
  ```

  #### Label: `report_status`

  Label values:
  ```
  "Success":  The reporting to the origin of test run status succeeded
  "Failed":   The reporting to the origin of test run status failed
  ```
