# Configuration

## Yaml Configuration
Pelican's preferred configuration mechanism is via a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file found at `/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml`. Each config
value is represented by a key-value pair. Below is an example configuration file with a key-value pair, a nested key-value pair, and a
list of key-value pairs.

```yaml  filename="/etc/pelican/pelican.yaml"
IssuerKeysDirectory: /some/directory

OIDC:
	ClientIDFile: /etc/pelican/oidc-client-id

Registry:
  Institutions:
    - id: 0
      name: institution0
    - id: 1
      name: institution1
```

## Environment Variable Configuration

Pelican configuration is typically set via the `pelican.yaml` file, in part because config parameters that
have the `object` type cannot be fully represented with environment variables. If, however, there is a corresponding
environment variable set in the shell where the command is executed, that will override the configuration provided in
the `pelican.yaml` file.

<Callout type="warning">
  Using environment variables to change the configuration means the state of the Pelican component
  is not easily reproducible, especially if inheriting the environment from multiple parents.
  Furthermore, the changes will be lost upon restart of the host machine/container.
  While this approach is useful for testing changes to the configuration,
  any "permanent" changes should be set via the appropriate `pelican.yaml` file.
</Callout>

### Syntax

The environment variable name is constructed from the one-line address of the configuration parameter,
e.g., `Level1.Level2`, as follows:

1. Capitalize all letters.
2. Replace the period `.` with an underscore `_`.
3. Prefix with `PELICAN_`

This leads to an environment variable name of the form `PELICAN_LEVEL1_LEVEL2`.

### Examples

To demonstrate the syntax for setting the environment variable,
consider the following examples.

To set the logging level for a Pelican component to "Debug" in the `pelican.yaml` file,
you would use the following:

```yaml
# /etc/pelican/pelican.yaml
Logging:
  Level: Debug
```

To set the logging level for a Pelican component to "Debug" via an environment variable,
you would use

```bash
export PELICAN_LOGGING_LEVEL=Debug
```

Note that the environment variable is prefixed by `PELICAN_` and
that the nested keys are capitalized and separated by underscores (`_`).
