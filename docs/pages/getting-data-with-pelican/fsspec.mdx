# Pelican's Python FSSpec

## What is FSSpec?

[FSSpec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), short for Filesystem Specification, is a Python library that provides a
unified interface for interacting with various filesystems. It abstracts the complexities of different storage backends, allowing users
to work with local files, cloud storage, and other remote filesystems using a consistent API.

Pelican chose to develop an FSSpec implementation because it delivers maximum reward with less development effort by providing:
- **Unified Interface**: A consistent API for different filesystems, meaning many users already interact with FSSpec in their projects.
- **Extensibility**: Robust support for custom filesystem implementations Because Pelican is built on top of HTTP, our FSSpec is built on top of the
core HTTP FSSpec.
- **Compatibility**: FSSpec is used widely in the Python ecosystem, and already integrates seamlessly with tools like
[xarray](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs/tree/main/examples/xarray)
and [PyTorch data loaders](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs/tree/main/examples/pytorch).

While we're careful to say Pelican is a platform of tools for working with _objects_, because many of Pelican's storage backends don't have
a true filesystem interface[^1], FSSpec lets users interact with Pelican objects in a more familiar manner by translating common file operations
such as reading, writing, listing directories, and more, without worrying about the underlying storage technology.

## How to Get it
Instructions for downloading and working with Pelican's FSSpec library can be found on our [FSSpec Github repository](https://github.com/pelicanplatform/pelicanfs).
