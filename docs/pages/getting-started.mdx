# Getting Started

This page is intended to help users and administrators find the right documentation to accomplish what they need to. Each section header describes the
type of actions that section is intended to help with.

## Getting Objects From An Existing Federation

Objects are referenced in Pelican using `pelican://`-schemed URLs, which help Pelican clients identify the correct federation and routing information
they need to find the source of any object. Whether you know the `pelican://`-url name of your object or not, you can find a quick tutorial for interacting
with data using the Pelican command line client at [Accessing Data](./getting-started/accessing-data.mdx).

For a more complete walkthrough of Pelican's clients, see [Getting Data with Pelican](./getting-data-with-pelican.mdx), which discusses each of Pelican's
clients and explains how to find detailed documentation for each.

This page also discusses the general methods for providing authorization to access "protected" objects through a federation.

## Adding Your Data To an Existing Federation
A goal of Pelican is to make data easily accessible regardless of how it's stored. If you have data and you want to add it to a federation, you have two options:<br />
**a)** Use a Pelican client to write the data from its existing storage location to a location already federated via a Pelican Origin<br />
**b)** Connect your own Pelican Origin to the data wherever it's already stored

Choosing the option that's best for you depends on a few factors, like how much data you have and whether you have previous experience administering servers. Pelican
aims to make the process of running an Origin as simple as setting up a new home wifi router, but until we've realized that goal you may be better off working
with an existing Origin administrator. If you plan to add this data to the OSDF, you can get help by emailing [support@osg-htc.org](mailto:support@osg-htc.org).

### Use a Pelican Client to Write Data via an Origin
You can use Pelican clients to write data to a location within an existing federation. Such write (or PUT) actions using a Pelican client require that you provide
some form of authorization.

For more information on the authorization process, see [Getting Data with Pelican](./getting-data-with-pelican.mdx).
> **NOTE:** Make sure you use the authorization method required by the maintainer of the namespace within the federation (which may not be the same as the
maintainer of the federation).

### Serving An Origin
If you maintain the storage for the data you want to share, you can connect your storage system to an existing federation.

Integrating your data with a Pelican federation starts by serving an Origin in front of whatever service already holds the data. Origins are a critical
component in Pelican federations because they act as the adapter plug that lets a broad variety of storage technologies (posix, S3, HTTP, Globus, etc)
interact with Pelican's clients and caching infrastructure.

For a more complete discussion of Origins and how you can run your own, see [Federating Your Data](./federating-your-data.mdx).

> **NOTE:** You should contact the federation maintainer to discuss their requirements/recommendations for setting up an Origin.

## Sharing Your Storage Resources

If you administer storage resources and you want to share them with a Pelican federation, you can do so by:<br />
**a)** Serving a Cache ([see below](#serving-a-cache)), or<br />
**b)** [Serving an Origin](#connect-your-data-storage-to-an-existing-federation-through-serving-an-origin)<br />

Both options will benefit data consumers, but which you choose may depend on your particular hardware. For example, Pelican Caches work best when
they're run with low-latency storage like modern NVMe SSDs and high-bandwidth network connections. Origins, on the other hand, are assumed to be less performant.

In either case, sharing your storage resources will require some coordination with the administrators for your federation of choice. The best place to start is by
reaching out to them. If you know the hostname of your federation's Director, you can usually find a contact email at:
`< director hostname >/api/v1.0/director_ui/contact`.

### Sharing your storage resources with the OSDF
Have storage but don't know any federations to share it with? Consider contributing to the Pelican flagship [Open Science Data Federation
(OSDF)](https://osdf.osg-htc.org/). This well-established federation is used to distribute data within the
[OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html), a national distributed computing system that is accessible to any researcher affiliated with a
US academic institution. The OSDF is connected directly with network backbones like ESNet and Internet2, enabling researchers across the country to incorporate
their data in their OSPool workloads.

> **Note:** If you or your campus have a storage allocation granted through something like the NSF's
[CC*](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cc-campus-cyberinfrastructure) program, contributing storage to the OSDF can help satisfy some grant requirements.

### Serving a Cache
Pelican federations are built from the ground up to take advantage of distributed object caching. Pelican Caches enable a federation to distribute data -
especially frequently reused data - even more efficiently.

This means that even if you don't have data to share in a federation, you can help a federation run more efficiently by serving a cache that utilizes your
existing storage resources.

If you are interested in contributing a cache to an existing federation, see [Operating a Federation/Cache](./operating-a-federation/cache.mdx) for the general
process.

## Starting Your Own Federation

The Pelican flagship [Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)](https://osdf.osg-htc.org/) is a highly-performant, well-established federation connected directly with network
backbones like ESNet and Internet2. In the majority of cases, we recommend you join the OSDF to gain access to this infrastructure. However, if the OSDF does not do not
meet the requirements for your data distribution needs, you can still leverage the power of Pelican by launching and maintaining your own Pelican federation.

The process of running/managing a Pelican object federation involves setting up two primary services: a Registry and a Director.
These services are called the federation's "Central Services", and together they handle the registration/verification of Caches and Origins (Registry),
and maintaining an understanding of where clients should be sent to interact with objects (Director).

You can find more information about operating these services in the [Operating a Federation](./operating-a-federation.mdx) section. Information specific to
Directors can be found in the sub page titled [Director](./operating-a-federation/director.mdx) while information for Registries can be found in the sub page
titled [Registry](./operating-a-federation/registry.mdx).
