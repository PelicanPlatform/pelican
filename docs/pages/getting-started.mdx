# Getting Started

This page is intended to help users and administrators find the right documentation to accomplish what they need to. Each section header describes the
type of actions that section is intended to help with.

## Getting Existing Data From An Existing Federation

Objects are referenced in Pelican using `pelican://`-schemed URLs, which help Pelican clients identify the correct federation and routing information
they need to find the source of any object. Whether you know the `pelican://`-url name of your object or not, you can find a quick tutorial for interacting
with data using the Pelican command line client at [Accessing Data](./getting-started/accessing-data.mdx).

For more complete walkthrough of Pelican's clients, see [Getting Data with Pelican](./getting-data-with-pelican.mdx), which discusses each of Pelican's
clients and explains how to find detailed documentation for each.

## Adding Your Data To an Existing Federation

Integrating your data with a Pelican federation starts by serving an Origin in front of whatever service already holds the data. Origins are a critical
component in Pelican federations because they act as the adapter plug that lets a broad variety of storage technologies (posix, S3, HTTP, Globus, etc) 
interact with Pelican's clients and caching infrastructure.

For a more complete discussion of Origins and how you can run your own, see [Federating Your Data](./federating-your-data.mdx).

## Sharing Your Storage Resources

Pelican federations are built from the ground up with distributed object caching in mind. This lets well-established federations like the [OSDF](https://osdf.osg-htc.org/),
where there are many highly-performant cache machines plugged directly into network backbones like ESNet and Internet2, operate much more efficiently.

If you or your campus have a storage allocation through something like the NSF's [CC*](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cc-campus-cyberinfrastructure) program, or
you're otherwise interested in establish a cache for your institution or the broader OSDF, see our documentation titled [Cache](./operating-a-federation/cache.mdx) for more
information.

## Starting Your Own Federation

The process of running/managing a Pelican data federation involves setting up two primary services: a Registry and a Director.
These services are called the federation's "Central Services", and together they handle the registration/verification of Caches and Origins (Registry),
and maintaining an understanding of where clients should be sent to interact with data (Director).

For information on serving a Director, see the section titled [Director](./operating-a-federation/director.mdx). For information on serving a Registry, see
the section titled [Registry](./operating-a-federation/registry.mdx).
