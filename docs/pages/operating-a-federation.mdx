# Operating a Pelican Federation

A federation in Pelican refers to an instance of a data sharing ecosystem where members can share and access data as objects. To
allow such an exchange of data to work, Pelican has two top-level *central service components* to coordinate origins and caches in the
federation, direct client requests to the proper storage server, and manage namespace registration. They are the *Director* and the *Registry*.
A Pelican federation requires both a *Director* and a *Registry* to be set up first before any origin or cache server can join
the federation or any client can access objects in the federation.

## Before Starting

### Install Pelican

If you haven't installed Pelican, follow the instructions to [install Pelican](/install.mdx).

### Prepare TLS Credentials

Pelican servers use `https` for serving its web UI, handling objects transfer requests and internal http requests. `https` requires a set of credential files in place to work. For details on how to set up the TLS credentials, refer to [Federating Your Data](./federating-your-data.mdx#prepare-tls-credentials) page.


## Next Steps

Follow the instructions below for serving a specific Pelican federation component.

* [Serve a Pelican Registry](./operating-a-federation/registry.mdx)
* [Serve a Pelican Director](./operating-a-federation/director.mdx)
* [Serve a Pelican Cache](./operating-a-federation/cache.mdx)
