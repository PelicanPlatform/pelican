# Install Pelican

This document lists the operating system requirements for Pelican and explains how a user can download and install Pelican.

## Before Starting

Pelican executables can run as a **client** or a **server**.

To use the client for interacting with data, download and install the Pelican package or Pelican Binary [following the instructions below](#install-pelican-binary).

For server usage, such as serving your data to a Pelican data federation or to start a new Pelican data federation, you need to run Pelican using [Pelican Docker images](./install/docker.mdx). It is not recommended to run Pelican server with a binary. Although technically possible, additional software dependencies and configurations are required to make the binary functional for server usage.


## Supported Operating Systems

Pelican supports the following operating systems, when running as a **client**:

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS, Fedora, Alma, Rocky, or openSUSE)](./install/rhel.mdx)
* [Debian or Ubuntu](./install/debian.mdx)
* [Alpine Linux](./install/alpine.mdx)
* [macOS](./install/macos.mdx)
* [Windows](./install/windows.mdx)

> **Note**: Installation of Pelican on other operating systems is possible, but not recommended or supported.

## Download Pelican Binary

Download the binary based on your operating system and CPU architecture. For instructions on how to install the binary, refer to [the next section](#install-pelican-binary).

### What version should I download?
Our versions are built like so:
For example: 7.1.2
- 7 represents the major version release
- 1 represents feature releases
- 2 represents a bug fix/patch release

The download table above includes Pelican versions as old as `7.6.x` To download older versions, please refer to the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases).

## Install Pelican Binary

### Linux

* [Install Pelican on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS, Fedora, Alma, Rocky, or openSUSE)](./install/rhel.mdx)
* [Install Pelican on Debian or Ubuntu](./install/debian.mdx)
* [Install Pelican on Alpine Linux](./install/alpine.mdx)

### macOS

* [Install Pelican on macOS](./install/macos.mdx)

### Windows

* [Install Pelican on Windows](./install/windows.mdx)


### Install OSDF or Server Package

Pelican has two special packaging, `OSDF` and `Server`. The `OSDF` packaging, i.e. `pelican-osdf-compat`, is for running Pelican in Open Science Data Federation (OSDF). The `Server` packaging, i.e. `pelican-server` is for running Pelican services, e.g., an *Origin* or a *Cache*.

Both of the packages **require Pelican package to be installed first**. You may get the following error message if you only install the special package:

```console
Problem: conflicting requests
  - nothing provides pelican needed by pelican-osdf-compat-7.8.5-1.aarch64 from @commandline
```

To fix the issue, install the Pelican package first by following [the instructions](#install-pelican-binary) above.

## Verify Pelican Is Installed

> If you installed Pelican as a standalone binary, or if you installed Pelican on macOS or Windows operating systems, you need to add Pelican to your `PATH` environment variable before proceeding. Follow the instructions for [Linux](./install/linux_binary.mdx#add-pelican-binary-to-your-path-permanently), [macOS](./install/macos.mdx#add-pelican-binary-to-your-path), and [Windows](./install/windows.mdx#add-pelican-binary-to-your-path).

1. Run the following command after you installed Pelican

    * **Linux and macOS**:
        ```bash
        which pelican
        ```

        It should output something similar to

        ```console
        /bin/pelican
        ```
    * **Windows**:
        ```bash
        where pelican
        ```

        It should output something similar to

        ```console
        C:\Program Files\Pelican\pelican.exe
        ```

2. Test Pelican client function by running an **object copy** command that downloads a test file from [Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf) to your current directory

    ```bash
    $ pelican object copy pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt .
    test.txt 14.00b / 14.00b [=============================================================================================] Done!
    ```

## Next Steps

* [Access data with Pelican client](../client-usage.mdx)
* [Serve your data with Pelican Origin server](../serving_an_origin.mdx)
* [Serve a new Pelican Pelican federation](../serving_a_federation.mdx)
