### RPM, APK, or DEB?

#### RPM (Red Hat Package Manager):
You want to install a `.rpm` package if you are using a Red Hat-based Linux distribution system such as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE.

#### APK (Alpine Package Keeper):
You want to install a `.apk` package if you are using an Alpine Linux system.

#### DEB (Debian Package):
You want to install a `.deb` package if you are using a Linux distribution system such as: Debian, Ubuntu, or something similar.

#### What about tar and zip?
If you want a more manual setup, you can download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` files and extract the binary where you need it. However, the above packages are recommended for more inexperienced users.

### What version should I download?
Our versions are built like so:
For example: 7.1.2
- 7 represents the major version release
- 1 represents feature releases
- 2 represents a bug fix/patch release

The download section above always shows the latest released version of Pelican and we recommend you to use the latest feature or major release version so it includes the latest bug fixes and features. If you would like to download a previous version, please refer to our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases).
