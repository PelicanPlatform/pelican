# Install Pelican

This document lists the operating system requirements to install Pelican and explains how a user can download Pelican client or Pelican server components.

> Pelican also has Docker images for users who want to serve **Pelican servers**. Refer to [Run Pelican Server using Docker image](./install/docker.mdx) for instructions.

## Supported Operating Sytems

Pelican supports the following operating systems:

* [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS, Fedora, Alma, Rocky, or openSUSE)](./install/rhel.mdx)
* [Debian or Ubuntu](./install/debian.mdx)
* [Alpine Linux](./install/alpine.mdx)
* [macOS](./install/macos.mdx) [*]
* Windows [*]

> Note that for macOS and Windows, Pelican only supports the _client_ functionality but not the _server_ functionality. To launch a Pelican server on macOS or Windows, use [Pelican Docker image](./install/docker.mdx) instead.

> Note that installation of Pelican on other operating systems is possible, but not recommended or supported.

### RPM, APK, or DEB?

#### RPM (Red Hat Package Manager):
You want to install a `.rpm` package if you are using a Red Hat-based Linux distribution system such as: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, or openSUSE.

#### APK (Alpine Package Keeper):
You want to install a `.apk` package if you are using an Alpine Linux system.

#### DEB (Debian Package):
You want to install a `.deb` package if you are using a Linux distribution system such as: Debian, Ubuntu, or something similar.

#### What about tar and zip?
If you want a more manual setup, you can download the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` files and extract the binary where you need it. However, the above packages are recommended for more inexperienced users.

### What version should I download?
Our versions are built like so:
For example: 7.1.2
- 7 represents the major version release
- 1 represents feature releases
- 2 represents a bug fix/patch release

The download section above always shows the latest released version of Pelican and we recommend you to use the latest feature or major release version so it includes the latest bug fixes and features. If you would like to download a previous version, please refer to our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican/releases).
