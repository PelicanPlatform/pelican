# Federating Your Data

## The Role of Origins in Pelican Federations
Data is made accessible via Pelican through Origins -- the service that acts like a universal adapter plug allowing Pelican clients to interact with a wide variety of
underlying storage technologies. From posix filesystems to S3 cloud storage, Origins translate Pelican client commands into requests that work natively with whatever
holds the actual objects/files. It's important to note that Origins often do not store the objects themselves, which is why we say data is access _via_ Pelican and not
_from_ Pelican.

Not only do Origins translate requests to/from the data repository, but they're also the component responsible for telling the federation they have data from some
namespace in the federation. That is, you may have one Origin that ties the S3 bucket `foo` to the namespace `/my-origin/foo` while also tying the bucket `bar` to the
federation prefix `/my-origin/bar`. When this Origin talks to the Director, it tells the Director which namespaces it supports so that requests for `/my-origin/foo` are
forwarded by the Director to the correct Origin.

For those who want to make their data accessible via Pelican, the Origin is the service they'll get to know most intimately. It's the place where data owners can define
what data is federated, craft fine-grained access policies to describe who/how the objects are accessed, and monitor how users are interacting with the data.

Generally speaking, an Origin's configuration has a few key elements (not including stuff like TLS configuration, which is needed by all Pelican servers).
These include:
- **Storage Type**: The underlying storage technology the Origin will be translating on behalf of. Valid options include (but may not be limited to) POSIX, S3, HTTP, Globus
and XRootD.
- **Exports**: The actual sections of the storage instance that are going to be made available through the Origin. For each export, some namespace prefix is tied to some portion
of the underlying storage. For example, in posix, each export generally points to some distinct directory tree, allowing the origin admin to map unique namespaces to certain
pieces of the filesystem. For S3, exports usually point to individual buckets.
- **Capabilities (per export)**: The access policy imposed on users when accessing objects from this part of the namespace.

Understanding how these pieces fit together and what each one enables allow Origin administrators to realize a vast array of conceivable configurations. Documents in this
section should help guide Origin administrators, both new and experienced, through the steps needed to add their data to their Pelican federation of choice.

## Namespaces and their Relationship with Origins
In general, the origin-namespace relationship should be thought of as many-to-many. One Origin may export multiple prefixes, as in the previous example, but one prefix
may also be [striped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_striping) across multiple Origins.

> **Note**: Pelican developers are still working on full support for situations where one prefix is spread across multiple Origins. At this time, certain client commands,
like those that involve object listing, may not behave entirely as expected in multi-origin, single-namespace setups.
