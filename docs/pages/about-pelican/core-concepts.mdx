# Core Concepts and Terminology

Pelican is a tool for building ***data federations***, a model in which decentralized, autonomous data repositories work together to make their data broadly available to
other members of the federation under a minimally-centralized structure. In this model, data is accessed through a unified namespace regardless of where the data comes
from or what type of storage is used to host it -- to a user, everything feels like it's coming from the same source.

## Terminology

### Objects
Pelican should be thought of as a tool that works with federated *objects* as opposed to *files*. The reason for this is that calling something a file carries with it the
connotation of a filesystem. File systems have extra features such as owners, permissions, etc., which Pelican does not implement. In addition, a *file* gives the connotation
that the file is mutable, i.e., its contents can change without requiring a new name. Objects in a Pelican federation, however, should be treated as **immutable**, especially
in any case where objects are pulled through a cache (which will be the case for almost all files in the [Open Science Data Federation](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf),
or OSDF). This is because the underlying cache mechanism, powered by [XRootD](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/), will deliver whatever object it already has access to; if
an object's contents change at the origin, the cache will remain unaware and continue to deliver the old object. In the worst case, when the cache only has a partial object,
it may attempt to combine its stale version with whatever exists at the origin. Use object names wisely!

### Federations
Objects in Pelican belong to *federations*, which are aggregations of data that are exposed to other individuals in the federation. Each Pelican
federation constitutes its own global namespace of objects and each object within a federation has its own path, much like files on a computer.
Fetching any object from a federation requires at minimum two pieces of information: the federation's root (i.e. the discovery URL), and the path
to the object within that federation (there is the potential that some objects require access tokens as well, but more on that later). For example,
the OSDF’s federation hostname is `osg-htc.org`, an example path to an object in the federation is:

```bash copy
/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt
```

Combining these two pieces of information, we say the the **object's URL** is:

```bash copy
pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt
```

### Namespace or Federation Prefixes
Each origin supports one or more *namespace prefixes*, which are analogous to the folders or directories from your computer that you use to organize files. The terms
"namespace prefix" and "federation prefix" may be used interchangeably throughout this documentation.

Below is an example of a full Pelican object name:

```bash
pelican://osg-htc.org/demo/testfile.txt
```

In this example, the full object name encodes the federation (osg-htc.org), and some path within that federation -- `/demo/testfile.txt`. When new Pelican object
servers are added to a federation (called Origins), they act on behalf of some subpath within the federation, called a namespace or federation prefix. In the above
example, the origin providing access to the object likely acts on behalf of `/demo` namespace. 

These namespace prefixes are a way for data owners to carve out sections of a federation in a way that ties namespace ownership/management to a public-private keypair.
In this way, the group that owns the `/demo` namespace can make decisions on its behalf, including the creation of further sub namespaces and the ability to make decisions 
about the read/write permissions of the namespace's underlying objects. Using the "directory permissions" analogy, the owner of the `/demo` directory gets complete control
over what happens in the directory, including the ability to delegate the creation of further subdirectories to other users who have access to `/demo`.

Starting with a full Pelican URL object  name can make it tricky to determine where the actual namespace prefix ends and the underlying object name (as understood by the
Origin's configured data repository) begins. For example, this test object has a deeply-nested path:
```bash copy
pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt
```

In this example, the namespace prefix happens to be `/ospool/uc-shared/public/`, and this is hosted by a posix origin that exports a directory tree containing
`/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt`.

In most cases, users don't need to know the namespace/object name split for the objects they'd like to interact with -- knowing the full pelican URL is generally sufficient.
However, understanding this becomes more important for those who want to federate their own data by hosting an Origin, or for some types of troubleshooting. Pelican provides
several tools for determining which portion of the path constitutes the namespace prefix.

#### Differentiating Namespace Prefixes and Object Names
One way to determine the namespace prefix associated with an object is to access your federation's registry (e.g. [https://osdf-registry.osg-htc.org/view/registry/](https://osdf-registry.osg-htc.org/view/registry/))
which should list all prefixes registered in the federation. Using the search bar, you can start typing the path component of your object's name, and matching prefixes will
be filtered for you.

Another way to get this information is by interacting with the federation Directly using an HTTP client like curl. The following command is an example of a valid request to and
response from the OSDF Director for the `pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt` object:
```bash
$ curl -v https://osdf-director.osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt
> GET /ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt HTTP/2
> Host: osdf-director.osg-htc.org
> user-agent: curl/7.76.1
> accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/2 307

```

Note that the `X-Pelican-Namespace` header has a "namespace" attribute explaining which portion of the path is the registered namespace.

## Core Entities

Pelican federations consist of 6 core entities:

{/* no toc */}
- [Clients](#clients)
- [Data Repositories](#data-repository)
- [Origin Servers](#origins)
- [Cache Servers](#caches)
- Central Services (the [Director](#director-service) and [Registry](#registry-service))

where each of these federation stakeholders represents a unique set of interests. One of Pelican's core functionalities is balancing the sometimes-competing
needs of each of its constituents.

A description for each of these entities is provided below.

### Clients

Pelican views itself as serving two types of users; data providers and data consumers. *Pelican Clients* are the tools built around Pelican that support consumers,
enabling them to download data via a federation. Pelican currently has three Clients, and more are under development. Existing Clients include the
[Pelican CLI tool](install.mdx), the [Pelican FSSpec](https://github.com/pelicanplatform/pelicanfs) for Python, and a file transfer plugin for
[HTCondor](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/file-transfer.html#file-transfer-using-a-url).

Pelican Clients are designed to work with `pelican://`-style URLs, which defines a metadata lookup protocol on top of HTTP. For more information on this URL
specification, see Pelican's [client usage documentation](./getting-data-with-pelican/client.mdx).

Lastly, because Pelican builds on top of HTTP, most HTTP clients (e.g. curl) can be modified to interact with Pelican federations.

### Data Repository

Data can live in any number of places, from a hard drive with an associated POSIX filesystem, to buckets in S3. Pelican defines a *Data Repository* as any instance
of a storage backend.

Data Repositories often have their own policies that are unique from federation policies, including things like authentication/access control and rate limiting.

Pelican's primary goal with respect to Data Repositories is to make the data they hold accessible to clients within a federation, without requiring that users know
what type of repository the data comes from or how it works.


### Origins

To make data from a Repository available through a Pelican federation, the data provider must serve an *Origin* in front of the Repository.

Origins are a crucial component of Pelican's architecture for two reasons: they act as an adapter between various storage backends and Pelican federations, and they
provide fine-grained access controls for that data. That is, they figure out how to take data from wherever it lives and transform it into a format that the clients
from the federation can utilize while respecting the Repository's data access requirements. This implies an inherent trust relationship between Origins and Data
Repositories, as the Origin is responsible for enforcing the Repository's needs and wishes within the rest of the federation. However, while the Origin is responsible
for translating the Repository's data access policies into something the federation can understand, Pelican is designed so that Origins never need to share secrets with
their federation.

Pelican Origins work by making their underlying Repository accessible under some namespace path via HTTPs, which is accomplished by building on top of
[XRootD](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/). The namespace path, also called the *federation prefix*, is the path at which data from the Origin can be accessed in the
federation. For example, an Origin that exports the namespace path `/foo` might provide access to an object `bar` in the underlying Data Repository. The full path for this
object in the federation would be `/foo/bar`.

> **NOTE**: An important distinction between Origins and Data Repositories is that, generally speaking, Origins do **NOT** store any data themselves; their primary function
is to facilitate data access *from* the Repository, which may not coincide on the same machine.

### Caches

Pelican *Caches* are responsible for storing copies of data inside the federation with the goal of providing more efficient access to reusable data. By default, requests to
a Pelican federation for an object are proxied through a Cache, resulting in the federation storing a temporary copy of the object. Currently, objects are cleared from Caches
based on a "least recently used" algorithm whenever the server begins running out of storage space, but more robust forms of cache management are in active development. Like
Origins, Caches build on top of [XRootD's "Proxy Storage Services."](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/dev56/pss_config.pdf)

Because Caches store copies of data for re-distribution in the federation, they must also respect the Origin's data access policies. That is, the Origin should trust Caches
to protect any data that isn't marked as publicly accessible. Caches in a Pelican federation accomplish this by aggregating access policies from the Origins they support and
following the same approval/denial rules the Origins themselves would follow.

Generally, Caches are operated by the federation and placed close to computing clusters where data may be quickly re-used as part of High-Throughput Computing workflows, but
this is not a requirement.

### Central Services

It was mentioned that data federations operate under a minimally-centralized structure. In Pelican, this structure is made up of the *Central Services*, namely the *Director*
and the *Registry*.

> **NOTE**: Pelican's Central Services are responsible for connecting Data Repositories and data consumers, but a core part of Pelican's architecture is that objects never pass
through the Central Services. In fact, the federation’s Central Services are unable to access any authorization-protected objects via Origins unless the Origin mints a token
granting that permission. In this way, Origins that don’t allow their data to be staged/cached in the federation need not trust the federation operators, because each Origin
acts as its own token issuer and is solely responsible for deciding which requests to respect. This architecture also prevents the creation of centralized bottlenecks as a
federation grows.

#### Director Service

Data access in a Pelican federation requires two fundamental pieces of information -- the federation's hostname (also called the *root* of the federation), and the name of the
object within the federation. Notably, the hostnames of any Origins that facilitate access to objects are absent from that list. Instead, the Pelican model uses the federation
root to discover and route all Client requests for objects through its *Director*, an HTTP server whose job is determining the best location(s) at which to access a given object.
In some cases, this is accomplished by redirecting clients to a nearby Cache that might already have a copy of the object, and in other cases the Director might send the client
to an Origin that can provide direct access.

Generally, the Director's hostname is used as the federation's hostname because it auto-populates and makes available the federation's metadata. This information is hosted at
the *discovery endpoint*, a URL obtained by appending `/.well-known/pelican-configuration` to the federation's root. However, some federations may wish to set up the
Director/Registry as subdomains of the federation's hostname. For example, the OSDF breaks these two endpoints apart by providing federation metadata at osg-htc.org, which
then points to `osdf-director.osg-htc.org` and `osdf-registry.osg-htc.org`, respectively.

All Origins and Caches in a federation send periodic advertisements to the discovered Director at a default interval of 1 minute to let it know where they can be accessed,
which namespace(s) they provide, and any information pertaining to data access policies (such as authorization schemes). In this way, the Director is the only service that has
a nearly real-time view of all the Origins and Caches in the federation -- if an Origin or Cache fails to re-advertise after the required period (15 minutes by default), it is
assumed to be offline until another advertisement is received, and the Director will stop sending clients to that location.

#### Registry Service

Whenever a new Origin or Cache is created and added to a federation, its first step is to register itself with the *Registry*, which acts as the federation's locus of trust.
In the case of Origins, the process of registration entails sending the Registry the namespace prefix the Origin exports, along with the Origin's public key and a variety of
other bookkeeping information. After the Registry and the Origin have performed a handshake that proves the Origin owns the corresponding private key, the Registry stores the
information in a persistent database.

This process serves two purposes -- first, whenever the Origin re-advertises with the federation's Director, the Director can verify the authenticity of those advertisements
through public/private key asymmetric cryptography by looking at the Registry's stored public key for that Origin and namespace. Second, the Registry's persistent database
prevents other Origins from registering namespaces under an already-registered namespace without first proving they're allowed to do so by the namespace owner (i.e. the entity
that possesses the appropriate private key).
