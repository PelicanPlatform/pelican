# Accessing Data
The developers of the Pelican Platform believe data is the lifeblood of science. That's why Pelican provides a suite of tools that make it easy for researchers to federate their data, giving them the ability to share objects from a broad range of data repositories and allowing them to connect their data with distributed computational capacity, such as the OSPool. For more information on Pelican, visit the [About Pelican](../about-pelican.mdx) page.

## Before Starting

### Assumptions

Before using the Pelican client to interact with objects, this guide makes several assumptions:

- You are on a computer where you have access to a terminal. The Pelican client is a command line tool.
- You've already installed the version of Pelican appropriate for your system, and Pelican is accessible via your path. To test this on Linux, you can run

  ```bash copy
  which pelican
  ```
  which should output a path to the executable. If there is no output to this command, refer to the [Pelican installation docs](../install.mdx) to acquire a working installation.

### Useful Terminology

To learn our terminology and about Pelican's architecture, we recommend you read through the [About Pelican](../about-pelican.mdx) page and [Core Concepts and Terminology](../about-pelican/core-concepts.mdx) page to learn how Pelican works and how it can be useful to you.

## Your First Pelican Client Command
You can easily access public objects from a Pelican federation with the use of the Pelican client commands. Here we will be using the `pelican object get` command to get an object from a federation. This command is formatted like so:

```bash
pelican object get pelican://<federation-url>/<object-path> </local/path/to/destination>
```

We can break down the components of this command before you try it yourself:
- `pelican object get`: This is the client command we are utilizing. `object` because we want to interact with Pelican objects and `get` because we want to GET the file from our federation.
- `pelican://`: This is the URL scheme for accessing this object. Pelican accepts different URL schemes which are detailed in the [Pelican Client usage](./client_usage.mdx#the-different-pelican-url-schemes) page.
- `<federation-url>`: The URL indicating which federation you would like to interact with.
- `<object-path>`: The path to the object we would like to get.
- `</local/path/to/destination>`: The local destination where we want the file to download to (can be a local or absolute path)

### Try The Command Yourself
Now it is time for you to get your first object from a federation. Before getting your first object, be sure you are in a directory/location where you want to download this test file. To get the object, run the command below:

```bash copy
pelican object get pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt downloaded-test.txt
```

>**Note:** with pelican:// URLs like the one above, it is important to include the correct number of slashes (`/`). This is because pelican URLs rely on the hostname being the federation URL therefore, they must only contain two slashes after `pelican`. For more information, visit the [Pelican Client Usage](../getting-data-with-pelican/client.mdx#the-different-pelican-url-schemes) page

You should see a progress bar output and eventually a file named `downloaded-test.txt` within your local directory:

```bash
$ pelican object get pelican://osg-htc.org/ospool/uc-shared/public/OSG-Staff/validation/test.txt downloaded-test.txt
downloaded-test.txt 14.00 b / 14.00 b [==============================================================================] Done!
$ ls
downloaded-test.txt
$ cat downloaded-test.txt
Hello, World!
```
