# Origins can still be configured via the command line -v option
# However, unlike when we only supported single-export origins, the -v option
# now creates a list of exports. Using the -v option doesn't provide a mechanism
# to configure each export's capabilities, so we assume each export inherits
# whatever capabilities are set for the origin as a whole.

Origin:
  # Things that configure the origin, and thus the exports
