# Origins can still be configured via the command line -v option
# However, unlike when we only supported single-export origins, the -v option
# now creates a list of exports. Using the -v option doesn't provide a mechanism
# to configure each export's capabilities, so we assume each export inherits
# whatever capabilities are set for the origin as a whole.

Origin:
  # Things that configure the origin, and thus the exports
  StorageType: "s3"
  EnableDirectReads: true
  EnableListings: true
  EnableReads: true
  # Omit EnableListings so we can verify it defaults to false
  ExportVolumes:
    - ":/first/namespace"
    - "my-bucket:/second/namespace"
